hey what's going on everybody so in
0:01
today's video we're going to create a
0:03
compound interest calculator using
0:05
JavaScript HTML and CSS this will be
0:08
more of an exercise for beginners so why
0:10
don't you go ahead and sit back relax
0:13
and enjoy the show all right let's get
0:15
started everybody we will add all of our
0:17
HTML elements first followed by CSS
0:19
styling then add JavaScript
0:21
functionality at the end so within our
0:23
HTML file let's begin with an H1
0:28
heading my heading will will be
0:31
interest
0:34
calculator after this H1 element I will
0:36
create a form
0:38
element the form element will consist of
0:41
three labels and three input elements so
0:44
let's create a
0:45
label this label will be for the
0:48
principal amount how much are we
0:51
depositing initially or borrowing if
0:54
it's alone I think I spelled principal
0:56
right sometimes mix up principle with
0:58
principal then we will need an input
1:01
element to enter in a number I will set
1:04
the type equal to be
1:08
number the ID will be
1:14
principal with this label we will set
1:16
the four attribute to be
1:19
principal we're doing this so that if we
1:22
click on this label we'll select the
1:23
input element we should only be able to
1:26
enter in numbers we can't normally type
1:28
in any text
1:30
all right let's copy this label and this
1:32
input element paste it two additional
1:35
times the second label will have text of
1:40
interest
1:42
rate the four attribute will be rate the
1:46
ID will be
1:49
rate the third label will have text of
1:52
years after how many years has interest
1:55
accured the four attribute will be years
1:59
the ID will be
2:03
years then we'll add a
2:05
button we need a button
2:08
element the button will say
2:12
submit this button will have an onclick
2:14
attribute not on lick on
2:18
click equal to a JavaScript function
2:22
which we still need to declare we will
2:24
create a calculate function within
2:26
JavaScript we'll do that later though
2:31
at the bottom we'll display a total I
2:34
will use a paragraph element to do this
2:36
the IDE of this paragraph element will
2:38
be
2:40
total I will add the text of total
2:44
within this paragraph element after my
2:46
text of total I will include a span
2:49
element that has an ID of total Das
2:53
amount this will display a dollar amount
2:56
or some other unit of currency of you're
2:57
choosing for the time being I'll add a
3:00
placeholder of $0 and0 I'm using a span
3:03
element just because we're going to
3:05
style the dollar amount different from
3:07
the text of total all right that is all
3:10
the HTML elements we'll need let's head
3:12
to our CSS
3:13
stylesheet and I will Zoom back to 100%
CSS
3:17
let's select the body of our document
3:20
pick a font
3:21
family I will pick a son serif font
3:25
aerial is pretty good I'll add a backup
3:27
of s serif in case we can't display aial
3:30
I will change the background color of
3:32
our page to be something light gray but
3:37
I like using hsl
3:39
values let's set the lightness to be
3:42
like
3:43
95% okay not bad the form itself will be
3:47
a different
3:49
color let's select our H1
3:51
element I will change the font
3:55
color pick a
3:58
color
4:01
I'll set the lightness to be 30% for the
4:03
H1
4:06
element I'll increase the font
4:09
size to be 3
4:12
em then text align
4:17
Center next I will select the form
4:19
element that contains all of our labels
4:21
and input
4:23
elements I will change the background
4:27
color to be white
4:31
I will set a Max width of 350
4:37
pixels margin Auto to center
4:41
it I'll add a little bit of padding 25
4:46
pixels add a border radius to smooth the
4:50
corners uh let's go with 10
4:54
pixels I'll add a box
4:57
shadow box- shadow
5:00
5 pixels by 5 pixels and a blur of 10
5:06
pixels I'm going to lower the alpha on
5:09
this box Shadow so to do that you can
5:11
select a
5:13
color let's use hsl and I'm just going
5:16
to lower the alpha to
5:21
30% Alpha is very similar to opacity for
5:25
the elements within our form I'm going
5:27
to use flex box to order them display
5:31
Flex I will set the flex direction to be
5:34
a
5:38
column then align item
5:44
Center let's style the labels next that
5:48
would be the text of principal amount
5:49
interest rate and
5:51
years we will select all labels increase
5:55
the font size 2
5:58
em and I will set the font weight to be
6:03
bold let's select the input elements
6:08
next
6:10
input set the width to be
6:14
50% text align
6:19
Center that will Center the numbers
6:21
within the input
6:22
elements I'll increase the font size to
6:26
2
6:28
em I'll add a
6:32
border two pixel
6:36
solid but I'll change the
6:43
color I'll set the lightness to
6:47
90% add a border radius to round the
6:50
corners 5
6:54
pixels add a little bit of margin to the
6:58
top five
7:00
pixels then margin bottom 15
7:06
pixels all right let's style our button
7:09
next we are selecting our
7:13
button I will change the background
7:16
color to something
7:21
green I'll set the lightness to
7:26
40% change the font color to be white
7:31
increase the font
7:33
size 1.5
7:36
em remove the
7:38
border border
7:42
none border radius to smooth the
7:45
corners 5
7:48
pixels add some
7:50
padding 10 pixels by 15
7:55
pixels then change our cursor to be be a
7:59
pointer if we hover over the
8:01
button using the hover pseudo class
8:04
let's change the background color when
8:06
we hover over the
8:07
button we are selecting the button then
8:11
select the hover Pudo
8:13
class we'll change the background color
8:16
to have a lightness that's 10% darker
8:20
I'm going to use
8:21
30% and that does appear to
8:23
work then we need to style the total and
8:26
the total amount so these have IDs
8:30
we will select the ID of
8:34
total #
8:37
total I will increase the font size and
8:40
that's it to be 2
8:44
em then with that span this has an ID of
8:48
total
8:49
amount select the ID of total amount I
8:53
will change the color to be
8:55
green color green but I'll pick
8:59
something more
9:02
specific I will set the lightness to be
9:05
like
9:06
35% and to make the font weight bold
9:09
font weight
9:12
bold all right that is not a bad looking
9:16
form but now we need to add some
9:18
functionality so let's do that so within
JavaScript
9:21
our HTML file the button has an onclick
9:24
attribute set equal to this JavaScript
9:27
function but we haven't defined that
9:29
function yet so let's do that now we
9:31
will create a function named
9:33
calculate So within our Javascript file
9:35
we will create a function to
9:38
calculate at the top of this function we
9:41
will create some constants for these
9:42
input elements and the total amount
9:46
we'll have const total amount equals
9:51
document. getet element by
9:55
ID the ID that we're getting is
9:59
total Dash
10:02
amount okay let's copy this line paste
10:06
it we're going to get the ID of this
10:08
input element for the principal amount
10:11
that had an ID of
10:15
principal this constant will be named
10:19
principal
10:20
input let's get the interest
10:23
rate that had an ID of rate rate in
10:30
then
10:33
years the ID was
10:37
years this constant will be named years
10:42
input we're going to get the values
10:44
within each of these number text
10:46
boxes let principal for the principal
10:51
amount equals take our principal input
10:56
access its value then store it with the
10:59
in this variable so that we can work
11:00
with it let rate equals the rate inputs
11:08
value but we want this to be a
11:10
percentage we'll divide this value by
11:12
100 if somebody were to enter in like
11:14
two dividing it by 100 would give us 02
11:18
meaning
11:20
2% and then let years equals our year
11:24
input access the
11:27
value normally with these input elements
11:30
we can only type in numbers right now
11:32
I'm trying to type in some text but it's
11:33
not letting me there are ways to
11:35
circumvent this for example if I were to
11:38
rightclick go to
11:42
inspect within my form within this first
11:45
number input element this input has a
11:47
type in number but I can easily change
11:49
that to be
11:51
text and now I can type in some
11:55
text just as an extra precaution I'm
11:58
going to to enclose these values with a
12:00
number cast so we'll cast them to be
12:12
numbers here's the formula to calculate
12:15
interest we will have a const result
12:19
equals we will take our principal amount
12:22
that would be the initial amount use the
12:25
power method of
12:27
math this will be the base we'll need a
12:30
set of
12:32
parentheses 1 plus our rate /
12:37
1 to the power we'll need a
12:40
comma 1 times the amount of
12:44
years and that is the formula we'll
12:47
need so to test everything let's take
12:50
our constant of total amount change the
12:54
text
12:56
content to equal the
13:00
result if I were to deposit $1,000 in
13:03
the bank maybe the bank has an interest
13:05
rate of 1% after one
13:08
year oh that's strange all right one
13:11
thing we're going to add to our button
13:13
we're going to set the type attribute
13:15
equal to be
13:17
button and that should fix that okay so
13:21
we deposit $1,000 with an interest rate
13:23
of one 1% after one year we'll have 1,00
13:29
0 but we're going to format this
13:32
currency with our result we will use the
13:34
built-in to local string
13:38
method the first argument is going to be
13:41
a location a local depending which
13:43
geographic location a user is viewing
13:45
this page we format numbers differently
13:48
to use the user's default the first
13:50
argument will be
13:52
undefined the second argument is an
13:55
object of options we can set these style
13:58
property
13:59
and to make this more readable I'm going
14:00
to put this on a new line so we can see
14:03
it I will set the style to be
14:08
currency the next
14:11
property that will be the
14:15
currency pick a type of currency I'll
14:18
use USD for American dollars all right
14:21
let's try this again I will deposit
14:25
$1,000 with an interest rate of one
14:27
meaning 1% after one year I should have
14:31
$1,110 with an interest rate of two that
14:34
would give me
14:35
$20 after 2 years that would give me
14:40
$1,404 if I were set the principal
14:42
amount to be $10,000
14:45
$1 with a 2% interest rate after 2 years
14:49
that would give me
14:51
$1,454
14:53
Cents Only problem with this is that
14:56
what if somebody types A negative
14:57
numbers
15:01
we would like to prevent that or at
15:03
least add some sort of check so before
15:05
we calculate the result we'll add a few
15:08
if statements let's check to
15:11
see if if our
15:14
principle is less than
15:18
zero then we will set the principle to
15:22
equal
15:24
zero let's do this with the
15:27
rate if the rate is less than zero set
15:30
the rate equal to zero so we don't get
15:31
negative numbers then
15:34
years if years is less than zero set
15:38
years to equal zero so if I type in
15:41
negative numbers like negative $1,000
15:43
with a negative 1% interest rate after
15:46
-2 Years it'll at least give me zero
15:49
instead of some negative number what if
15:51
somebody circumvents our precaution
15:53
where we only accept numbers for example
15:56
I'm going to inspect
16:00
go to the type set that equal to be
16:06
text I will set the principal amount to
16:09
be pizza with a 10% interest rate after
16:12
10 years well we end up with not a
16:15
number so within our if statements let's
16:19
use the or logical
16:20
operator or if our principal is not a
16:24
number is not a number
16:30
we'll set it equal to zero or if rate is
16:35
not a
16:37
number set the rate equal to
16:42
zero or if years is not a
16:46
number set it equal to
16:48
zero set the principal amount to be a
16:51
word like pizza with a 10% interest rate
16:54
after 10 years we're at least given zero
16:57
instead of not a number even better yet
17:00
after submitting if a number is invalid
17:03
like the word Pizza let's reset that to
17:06
be zero when we're checking our
17:08
principle within this if statement let's
17:11
set the principal inputs value to equal
17:15
zero let's do this with the
17:18
rate the value of the rate input will
17:22
equal
17:23
zero and the same thing with
17:26
Years Years input access the value set
17:30
it equal to zero let's try this again
17:33
going to go to
17:34
inspect set the type to be
17:39
text I'll do this with rate and years as
17:46
well pizza pizza pizza
17:52
submit and what am I
17:55
missing I just realized I had a typo
17:57
here make make sure that the N in N an
17:59
is
18:01
capital even if I were to enter in some
18:03
text like the word
18:06
Pizza they'll all at least reset to be
18:08
zero and then we'll calculate what the
18:10
interest rate is as if they were all
18:13
zero instead of getting you know not a
18:15
number all right everybody so that was a
18:18
compound interest calculator that you
18:20
can write using HTML CSS and
18:26
JavaScript
