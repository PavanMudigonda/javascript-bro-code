hey what's going on everybody in today's
0:01
video I'm going to show you how we can
0:02
create a stopwatch program using
0:04
JavaScript HTML and CSS so sit back
0:08
relax and enjoy the show all right let's
0:11
get started everybody we will create an
0:13
H1 heading with text of stopwatch and I
0:17
will give this H1 element a unique ID of
0:20
my
0:21
H1 then we'll create a container for our
0:24
stopwatch this will be a
0:27
development this development will have
0:29
an ID of container to contain everything
0:33
our container is going to have two
0:34
sections two div
0:41
elopements the first div element is
0:44
going to be for our display ID
0:47
display I'll give this development some
0:49
initial text as a placeholder we'll have
0:52
zeros for hours minutes seconds and
0:56
milliseconds then our next development
0:58
will have an ID of controls for all the
1:02
control buttons within this development
1:04
of controls we'll create three
1:07
buttons the first button will be start
1:11
the ID of this button will be start
1:14
button BTN short for button then I will
1:17
set the onclick event handler equal to a
1:20
JavaScript function we will eventually
1:23
create a start function we still need to
1:25
Define it let's copy this button paste
1:28
it twice
1:30
the second button will be for stop the
1:33
ID will be stop button the onclick
1:36
attribute will be for a stop function
1:39
the text on the button will be
1:42
stop and then we have a reset
1:44
button the ID is reset
1:47
button the onclick attribute will be for
1:50
a reset function the text on the button
1:53
will be
1:55
reset all right and that is all the HTML
1:58
that we need let's go to our CSS
CSS
2:01
stylesheet I will first select the body
2:03
of our document we'll use flexbox to
2:06
display everything because I like
2:08
flexbox display Flex the flex direction
2:13
will be a
2:15
column then I will align items
2:21
Center I'll set the background color of
2:23
this
2:25
application
2:28
background-color pick a color again I
2:30
like using hsl
2:32
values I'll set the lightness to
2:35
90% our container is going to be a
2:37
lighter color we will select the ID of
2:41
my H1 that's going to be the heading I
2:44
will set the font
2:45
size to be before
2:48
RM the font
2:50
family I will pick
2:54
aiel with a backup of s's
2:58
serif for the the font color I will set
3:01
the color property to be pick a
3:05
color I'll pick black but set the
3:07
lightness to
3:10
25% all right now we are going to select
3:12
the container that contains everything
3:14
besides the
3:16
heading this
3:17
area we will select the ID of
3:22
container I will use flex box within the
3:24
container display
3:27
Flex the flex direction will be
3:33
column and aligned item
3:39
Center let's add a border a border
3:42
around the container 5 pixel
3:47
solid and I will round the corners
3:50
border
3:52
radius let's do 50
3:55
pixels and I'll add a little bit of
3:58
padding
4:00
padding 30
4:02
pixels and I will set the background
4:05
color to be white background color
4:10
white we'll work on the time display
4:14
next select the ID of
4:18
display I will set the font
4:20
size to be 5
4:24
RM for the font
4:26
family I'm going to set it to be
4:28
monospace
4:32
and the font weight I will set to be
4:36
bold I'll change the
4:41
color I'll set the lightness to
4:43
30% I'll give a text Shadow to the
4:46
display so it looks like it's somewhat
4:48
3D like it's popping out so text
4:52
Shadow 2 pixels and two pixels for the
4:55
vertical and horizontal offset and a
4:58
blur of two pixels
5:01
now for the color I'm going to lower the
5:05
alpha to 75% or
5:11
so that's not bad then I'll add a little
5:14
bit of margin to the bottom margin
5:17
bottom 25
5:19
pixels now we have to style the buttons
5:23
we will select the ID of controls but I
5:26
would like the button elements within
5:27
the controls after after selecting the
5:30
ID of controls select any buttons within
5:33
that element we'll increase the font
5:36
size of the buttons font size 1.5 RM I
5:41
will set the font weight of the buttons
5:44
to be
5:46
bold I'll add a little bit of padding 10
5:49
pixels by 20
5:52
pixels I'll add some margin around the
5:54
buttons 5
5:57
pixels I'll set a minimum width of the
6:01
buttons to be 125
6:04
pixels let me scroll
6:06
down I'll remove the border border
6:11
none set the Border radius of the
6:14
buttons to be 10
6:16
pixels change our cursor to be a pointer
6:21
when we hover over the buttons let's see
6:23
if that works yes it
6:25
does then set the font color of the
6:28
buttons to be white
6:30
now let's color the start button we will
6:32
select the ID of start
6:35
button set the background
6:38
color pick a color I'll start with
6:40
something
6:44
green pick whichever color you would
6:51
like I'll pick this shade of green here
6:53
are the values when we hover over the
6:56
start button we will access the hover
6:59
suit class of our start
7:01
button I'll decrease the lightness by
7:05
10% let's copy the markup that we have
7:07
for the start button paste it
7:10
twice we'll add color to the stop
7:15
button and the reset
7:20
button I'll set the stop button to be
7:25
red here are the hsl values that I
7:28
picked
7:30
when I hover over this button I'll set
7:32
the lightness to be 10%
7:35
darker for the reset button I'll set
7:37
that to be
7:40
blue when we hover our cursor over the
7:43
reset button I will set the lightness to
7:46
be 10%
7:48
darker not bad for all of the buttons
7:51
I'm going to add a transition
7:54
effect
7:56
transition select the background color
8:00
we will create an ease
8:02
transition after 0.5 seconds we will
8:08
ease so when you hover your cursor over
8:10
the buttons there's going to be a slow
8:13
transition when we
JavaScript
8:17
hover okay and that is all the CSS that
8:19
we need we will now go to the Javascript
8:22
file to add some functionality let's
8:24
declare all the variables we'll need
8:26
we'll get the ID of the display and
8:28
store a reference to it const display
8:33
equals document. getet element by ID the
8:37
ID that I'm selecting is
8:41
display this
8:44
ID we will create a timer let timer
8:47
equals
8:49
null timer is going to hold the ID of
8:53
set interval so we can keep track of it
8:55
and stop it if we need to then we need
8:58
to start time let start time equal
9:01
0 let elapsed
9:04
time equal
9:07
0 let is running this will be a Boolean
9:12
which I will set to be
9:13
false if the stopwatch is currently
9:15
running we will flip this to be true and
9:18
flip it to be false to stop it what are
9:21
the functions that we need we have a
9:24
start stop and reset
9:28
function function
9:32
start function
9:37
stop function
9:40
reset we'll add one more function of
9:42
update to update the
9:45
display function
9:48
update we'll begin with the start method
9:51
we'll enclose everything within our
9:52
function within an if statement we need
9:55
to check to see if our stopwatch isn't
9:58
running if our stopwatch isn't currently
10:00
running if not running then start the
10:04
stopwatch we need to set the start time
10:07
the start time equals we will get the
10:10
current date date.now
10:13
minus the elapse time which will be zero
10:18
initially so just to demonstrate what
10:21
the start time is I'm going to
10:23
console.log my start
10:28
time
10:30
so the start time is going to be in
10:32
milliseconds since epic epic basically
10:35
speaking is when your computer thinks
10:36
time
10:42
begin we will set our timer equal to the
10:46
set interval
10:48
function we will call the update
10:50
function every 10
10:54
millisec so if I was to display my timer
10:58
console.log Tim
11:00
timer this is what it
11:04
is our timer stores a unique ID to work
11:07
with this function if we ever need to
11:09
stop
11:13
it we'll take the Boolean variable of is
11:16
running set it to be true because our
11:18
stopwatch is not running now we need to
11:21
go to the update function to actually
11:22
get it
11:23
working we need to get the current
11:26
time const
11:29
current time equals access our date use
11:35
the now method what is the date right
11:38
now we will calculate the elapse
11:41
time equals the current time minus our
11:47
start
11:48
time whatever that was when we initially
11:50
pressed the start
11:52
button so the current time minus our
11:55
original start time gives us the elapse
11:58
time and this is going to be in
12:00
milliseconds we need to convert the
12:02
elapse time into a readable format using
12:05
hours minutes seconds and milliseconds
12:08
we'll begin with
12:09
hours let hours
12:12
equals take our lapse time divided by to
12:17
convert milliseconds to hours we can
12:19
follow this formula elapse time divided
12:22
by 1,000 milliseconds * 60 seconds * 6
12:29
minutes we don't want any decimal
12:32
portions with our hours we will enclose
12:34
all of this with the floor method of
12:39
math now we're going to do something
12:41
similar with minutes let minutes equals
12:46
take our lapse
12:47
time we need to convert milliseconds to
12:51
minutes divided by 1,000 milliseconds in
12:55
a
12:56
second times 6 60 seconds in a minute
13:00
then modulus
13:02
60 modulus gives you the remainder of
13:04
any division we don't want our minutes
13:06
display to hit 60 or go above 60 once we
13:10
hit 60 it'll reset back to zero enclose
13:13
this formula with math. floor to round
13:16
it math.
13:19
floor okay then we have to take care of
13:21
seconds let seconds equals take our
13:26
lapse
13:27
time
13:29
divided 1,000 to convert milliseconds to
13:33
seconds modulus
13:36
60 en close all of this with math. floor
13:38
to round
13:43
it now for milliseconds let
13:47
milliseconds equals take the elapse time
13:51
which is already in
13:52
milliseconds modulus 1,00 milliseconds
13:56
is normally four digits we're going
13:58
going to divide it by 10 we only want
14:00
the first two
14:02
digits divided by 10 enclose all of this
14:06
with math.
14:07
floor math.
14:11
floor then let's change the
14:14
display we'll access our
14:18
display access the text content of the
14:21
display set it equal to a template
14:24
string if you would like to display the
14:26
hours it's optional we will add a
14:29
placeholder for hours colon placeholder
14:34
minutes colon placeholder seconds if you
14:39
would like to display the milliseconds
14:40
we can add a placeholder for that colon
14:43
placeholder
14:46
milliseconds let's see what we have so
14:48
far I'm going to hit the start button
14:51
and here's what we
14:53
got so the stopwatch is running but we
14:56
should add some zeros for padding so I'm
14:59
going to refresh to stop
15:00
it we'll convert hours minutes seconds
15:03
and milliseconds into a string then add
15:05
some padding of zeros to it if the
15:08
number is only one digit not two we will
15:11
convert hours minutes seconds and
15:12
milliseconds into a string before
15:14
displaying it so let's take hours equals
15:19
hours I will typ cast it as a
15:23
string follow this with the pad start
15:27
method
15:30
for the first two
15:32
digits add a zero let's do this for
15:35
minutes seconds and
15:37
milliseconds
15:39
minutes
15:41
seconds and
15:44
milliseconds we should have some zeros
15:46
for padding to make each display two
15:49
digits and that does appear to work
15:52
nice now we just need to get the
15:54
stopwatch to actually stop right now
15:57
there's no functionality
15:59
going to our stop function we need to
16:01
check to see if our program is running
16:03
is this variable is running
16:08
true if is running if that's true then
16:13
stop the
16:14
stopwatch we will use the clear interval
16:17
function we need to pass in that unique
16:19
ID for the
16:22
timer this will stop the stopwatch from
16:24
running then we will calculate the
16:26
elapse time csed time equals the date
16:32
right now date. now method minus the
16:36
original start
16:38
time then set is
16:41
running equal to false because the
16:44
stopwatch is stopped it's not running
16:47
anymore now we can start the
16:50
stopwatch and we can stop it we can
16:53
start it and we can stop it the last
16:56
thing we need to do is reset the stop
16:58
watch we can really just copy everything
17:00
that we have when we initially assign
17:02
these
17:04
variables we need to clear the timer
17:08
clear interval pass in our variable
17:12
timer that contains the ID of the set
17:14
interval
17:16
function the start time will be zero the
17:19
elapse time will be
17:21
zero is running will be
17:24
false change the text content equal to
17:30
all
17:32
zeros this is for the hours minutes
17:36
seconds and
17:38
milliseconds all right let's see if
17:40
everything works just fine we can
17:43
start we can
17:45
stop we can start we can stop we can
17:50
reset we can start and we can stop all
17:54
right everybody so that is how you can
17:56
create a stopwatch program using
17:58
JavaScript HTML and
18:04
CSS
