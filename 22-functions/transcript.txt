introduction
0:00
hey welcome back so today I gotta
0:02
explain functions in JavaScript a
0:04
function is a section of reusable code
0:07
you declare that code once and you can
0:09
use it whenever you want all you have to
0:11
do is call the function to execute that
0:13
code here's an example we'll create a
functions
0:16
function to sing Happy Birthday whenever
0:18
we call this function it's going to sing
0:20
Happy Birthday so to declare a function
0:22
you type
0:24
function a unique function name let's
0:27
name our function happy birthday because
0:30
it's well the happy birthday function
0:33
then you add a set of parentheses then
0:34
you add a set of curly braces any code
0:37
we write between this set of curly
0:38
braces we can reuse whenever we want
0:41
so what do we want to do exactly with
0:43
this function
0:44
I'll create the lyrics to my own Happy
0:46
Birthday song
0:48
console.log
0:52
happy
0:54
birthday to you let's repeat that again
0:59
happy birthday dear you
1:02
happy birthday to you
1:05
trust me I'm going somewhere with this
1:06
so we have a function when we run the
1:09
program it currently doesn't do anything
1:11
to execute this code within the function
1:13
we have to call the function by its name
1:16
happy birthday then add a set of
1:19
parentheses
1:20
so now we should execute this code yep
1:22
happy birthday to you happy birthday to
1:24
you happy birthday dear you happy
1:26
birthday to you
1:27
so to call a function you type the
1:29
function name then you add a set of
1:30
parentheses I like to think of the
1:33
parentheses as two telephones talking to
1:35
each other that's how I remember it so
1:38
if I were to call this function again
1:39
what do you think is going to happen
1:42
well we're going to execute this
1:44
function twice
1:45
three times
1:47
we'll execute it three times as many
1:49
times as I want in fact that's what a
1:51
function is it's a section of reusable
1:54
code reuse it whenever you want you just
1:56
have to call it you can send a function
arguments/parameters
1:59
some values or variables let's change
2:01
our happy birthday function I will turn
2:04
this line into a template literal
2:06
let's replace U with the placeholder
2:09
then we'll add a username
2:12
I'll add one more line
2:17
we'll use a template literal
2:20
you are insert a placeholder
2:23
age
2:25
ears old
2:28
so when I run this program
2:30
we have an uncaught reference error
2:32
username is not defined at happy
2:35
birthday so our happy birthday function
2:37
doesn't know what our username is or the
2:40
age so we can send some information to
2:43
the function when we call it so within
2:46
the set of parentheses what would we
2:48
like to send this function let's send
2:50
our name
2:54
so whatever values you place within the
2:56
function be sure to comma separate them
2:58
so why don't you go ahead and send the
3:01
happy birthday function a name and an
3:04
age
3:05
but there's one step missing these are
3:07
known as arguments their data that you
3:10
send a function but you need a matching
3:13
set of parameters within the parentheses
3:15
of the Declaration in a way we can
3:18
Define some temporary variables and
3:21
they're all comma separated we will
3:23
Define a username parameter as well as
3:26
age now this function should work
3:28
properly happy birthday dear bro code
3:31
you are 25 years old
3:33
so these are parameters and what you
3:36
send the function are arguments let's
3:39
call the function but send different
3:41
information
3:43
happy birthday
3:45
uh how about SpongeBob
3:48
will be I don't know how old he is
3:50
according to SpongeBob lore but let's
3:52
say he's 30 years old
3:54
happy birthday dear SpongeBob you are 30
3:57
years old
3:59
how about Patrick this time it's his
4:01
birthday
4:02
everybody gets a birthday
4:06
Patrick will be 37.
4:10
happy birthday dear Patrick you are 37
4:13
years old
4:14
so that's a benefit of passing arguments
4:16
to a function when the function receives
4:18
this data it can do something with it
4:20
now the order of the parameters does
4:23
matter if I were to switch age
4:26
and username here's what happens
4:30
happy birthday dear37 you are Patrick
4:33
years old
4:34
with the arguments that you're passing
4:36
to your function you'll want to be sure
4:38
that the parameters match up
return
4:40
all right now I'm gonna cover the return
4:42
keyword we'll create a few other
4:44
function examples
4:45
we'll create a function to add two
4:47
numbers function add
4:50
then we'll need two arguments which we
4:53
will name X and Y
4:56
so when we invoke this function I would
4:58
like to add X and Y together
5:00
I'll create a temporary variable named
5:03
result just to store the result
5:06
equals X Plus y
5:10
so I'm going to add two numbers together
5:13
let's add two and three together and
5:16
let's see what happens
5:18
well nothing appears to happen well we
5:21
can send some data back to the place in
5:24
which we call a function
5:25
but we need to use this return keyword
5:27
let's return the result
5:30
so two plus three should be 5. after
5:33
this function resolves think of this
5:36
function becoming the value 5. so we'll
5:39
probably want to do something with that
5:40
value
5:42
I'll store that within a variable
5:45
let answer
5:47
equal add two and three
5:51
then let's console.log the answer
5:55
which should be five
5:57
when you return something from a
5:59
function after you resolve the function
6:01
think of it as becoming whatever is
6:04
returned in this case it's our result
6:07
or otherwise I can place this function
6:10
within console.log if we don't plan to
6:13
store it at all
6:16
so add two and three then display the
6:19
result which is five
6:21
there is a shortcut too you don't
6:22
necessarily need to declare a variable
6:24
within this function
6:26
we could shorten this to
6:28
return X Plus y
6:32
that is also valid so that should return
6:34
5.
example 1
6:35
okay let's create a subtract function
6:39
function subtract
6:43
will return x minus y
6:47
well we need a matching set of
6:49
parameters because I forgot that
6:51
okay let's see what happens when we
6:53
subtract three from two that'll give us
6:56
negative one let's multiply
6:59
function
7:01
multiply
7:03
we'll multiply X and Y together
7:06
return x times y
7:09
we will multiply two times three which
7:12
is six
7:13
divide
7:19
we need parameters X and Y
7:22
then return x divided by y
7:25
then we will invoke the divide function
7:27
pass in two and three and the result is
7:30
0.66 repeating
example 2
7:33
let's go over a more complex example
7:35
we'll create a function to determine if
7:37
a number is even or odd
7:41
here's the function
7:44
function is even
7:47
we have one parameter
7:49
a number so when we invoke the function
7:52
we'll have to pass in a number
7:54
so when we receive a number how do we
7:56
check to see if this number is even
7:57
here's one solution
8:00
we'll use an if statement
8:03
if our number
8:06
modulus 2. modulus gives you the
8:09
remainder of any division
8:11
if this number divides by two evenly if
8:14
this is equal to zero and yes I'm using
8:18
the strict equality operator I'm trying
8:19
to use that more often if our number is
8:22
divisible by 2 then let's return
8:26
the Boolean value true
8:29
else will return
8:31
false okay
8:34
let's console.log
8:37
let's check to see if a number is even
8:39
let's start with 10 is 10 even
8:43
that is true
8:44
how about 11. that is false 12 12 is
8:48
even
8:50
so that's kind of cool
8:51
if you would like a shortcut for this
8:53
you can use the trinary operator that
8:55
would look something like this
8:57
we are going to return
8:59
then a condition what are we checking is
9:02
our number
9:03
modulus 2.
9:06
strictly equal to zero question mark so
9:09
that is the ternary operator the
9:11
question mark
9:13
if it is true then we will return a
9:16
Boolean value of true colon false if
9:19
it's false
9:21
is 12 even that is true
9:24
is 13 Even no it's not it's odd how
9:27
about 14. that is true
example 3
9:30
all right last example I think we're
9:32
probably getting the hang of this now
9:34
we'll create a function to see if an
9:36
email is valid
9:38
function
9:40
is valid email
9:44
what kind of information are we going to
9:45
send we'll set that up as a parameter
9:48
we will need an email
9:50
will invoke the is valid email function
9:54
and pass in an email why don't you type
9:55
in your email I'll just make one up bro
9:58
at fake.com
10:01
so when we invoke this function this
10:03
string of text will become our email
10:06
we'll check to see if our email contains
10:09
the at character
10:12
we'll use an if statement
10:14
if email and there's a built-in method
10:17
for this the includes method
10:21
if our email
10:23
includes
10:25
the at character
10:27
then we will return true that is a valid
10:31
email they have the at character
10:34
else we will return
10:36
false
10:38
is my email valid
10:40
that is true
10:42
let's remove the at character
10:44
brofick.com maybe it's a website or
10:47
something
10:48
that is false
10:50
let's try another email
10:52
again we're going to invoke the function
10:54
is valid email
10:57
Elon Musk
11:00
dot com don't actually go there I don't
11:03
know what's gonna pop up uh that is not
11:05
a valid email
11:07
all right how about
11:10
Zuckerberg
11:12
at meta.com
11:15
that is a valid email it contains a net
11:17
character
11:18
and for something like this if we're
11:20
returning either true or false we can
11:22
use the Trenary operator
11:25
return
11:27
then our condition is we're going to
11:28
check if our email includes the at
11:31
character
11:34
then add the ternary operator
11:37
if this is true return true
11:40
else we will return false so these
11:43
should be the same which they are
conclusion
11:45
all right everybody so that's an
11:47
introduction to functions it's a section
11:49
of reusable code you declare some code
11:52
once and use it whenever you want you
11:54
call the function to execute that code
11:56
if you need to send your function some
11:58
data you'll need a matching set of
12:00
arguments and parameters and you can
12:03
return something too with the return
12:04
keyword we'll have more practice with
12:06
this in the future don't worry and that
12:08
is an introduction to functions in
12:10
JavaScript
