intro
0:00
hey uh so today I'm gonna explain the
0:02
checked property in JavaScript the
0:05
checked property determines the checked
0:07
state of an HTML checkbox or a radio
0:10
button element by examining this
0:12
property we can determine if a check box
0:14
is checked or a radio button is selected
0:17
in this program if I were to not select
0:19
any of these buttons we have a different
0:21
result
HTML checkbox
0:22
within our HTML file we will create an
0:26
input element
0:27
the type
0:28
is going to equal checkbox
0:32
then for the ID I will set this equal to
0:36
my check box
0:39
and here's our checkbox
0:41
we should probably add a label so that
0:43
people know what this is for
0:47
so the label
0:49
I will set the for attribute to B my
0:53
checkbox
0:55
what's the label going to say
0:58
let's say subscribe like a subscribe
1:00
button utilizing the for attribute if
1:03
the four attribute is the same as the ID
1:06
when we click on the label it should
1:08
still select the checkbox
1:11
all right let's add a break then we will
HTML radiobuttons
1:14
create some radio buttons
1:16
we will again need an input element
1:19
the type this time will not be a check
1:22
box it will be radio
1:25
for the ID
1:26
this will be a v sub button
1:30
I'm going to abbreviate button to BTN so
1:33
pay attention to that
1:36
then I will create a label for this
1:38
radio button
1:40
we will set the for attribute to be the
1:43
same as the ID
1:46
then the text will be Visa
1:50
I'm going to add a break
1:54
okay let's copy this radio button paste
1:56
it two times
1:58
we'll change the second visa to be
2:00
MasterCard
2:03
let's change the ID first
2:05
Master Card
2:08
let's copy the ID paste it within the
2:11
four attribute of the second label
2:14
then change the text Master Card
2:19
then the third ID will be
2:22
PayPal button
2:25
then change the for attribute
2:27
and the text
2:29
PayPal so with radio buttons they should
2:32
all be within the same group currently
2:34
they're not so I can select all of them
2:36
if I would like we should only be able
2:39
to select one for many group we will
2:41
group these radio buttons by their name
2:43
attribute they should all have the same
2:45
name
2:46
the name let's say is card
2:49
so let's copy this attribute and paste
2:51
it within the other input elements
2:54
now we should only be able to select one
2:56
and that appears to work
other HTML elements
2:58
lastly let's create a submit button
3:02
we are creating a button
3:03
the text will be submit
3:07
the type is submit
3:10
and for the ID
3:12
will be my submit
3:15
I will create a paragraph element
3:18
we'll populate it with some text
3:19
depending if subscribe is checked or not
3:22
same thing goes with our radio buttons
3:25
I will create two paragraphs after our
3:28
button
3:29
the ID on the first paragraph
3:32
let's name sub result
3:35
there will be no text content to begin
3:37
with we'll change the text content of
3:40
our subresult paragraph with some text
3:43
that states if the user is subscribed or
3:45
not we'll create another paragraph for
3:47
the radio buttons again there's going to
3:49
be no text content
3:51
I'll set the idea this paragraph to be
3:54
payment result
CSS
3:55
now before we move to our JavaScript
3:57
file I'm just going to edit the CSS on
4:00
the button to make it a little bit
4:01
bigger so you guys can read it
4:03
so the ID of that button was my submit
4:07
we are selecting an ID my submit I will
4:11
set the font size to be one em
4:15
and that's probably good enough
4:18
uh maybe I'll add one more break after
4:20
the Subscribe button and the PayPal
4:23
radio button
4:25
just so that it's not as cramped
4:30
that's decent enough
4:32
okay so be sure to save your CSS file
4:34
your HTML file
4:37
then we are now within our JavaScript
JavaScript constants
4:39
file what we're going to do now is get
4:41
these elements by their ID and store
4:43
them within constants so they're easier
4:45
to work with okay let's start with our
4:47
check box so the checkbox had an ID of
4:50
my checkbox
4:52
const my checkbox be sure to pay
4:56
attention to the capitalization
4:58
feel free to change that if you would
5:00
like just be sure it's consistent with
5:02
what you have currently with your HTML
5:03
elements
5:04
we are accessing the document of our web
5:07
page get element by ID
5:11
the ID is going to be my checkbox
5:16
and that's it so let's get the other
5:18
elements
5:19
we have my check box
5:21
then we have our Visa button
5:25
const Visa button get Elements by ID
5:28
Visa button
5:31
then let's repeat this with our
5:33
MasterCard button again pay attention to
5:35
the capitalization it's pretty important
5:40
then we have our PayPal button
5:45
we need our submit button next
5:49
my submit
5:53
then our paragraph elements
5:55
sub result
6:02
then payment result
6:06
all right here are all the constants
onclick property
6:08
that we'll need
6:09
so when we click on the submit button we
6:12
will execute a function
6:14
so we are taking my submit that's the
6:16
name of the button
6:17
dot on click
6:20
I keep on spelling on lick on click
6:23
equals
6:25
a function parentheses curly braces when
6:28
we click on the button what are we going
6:30
to do
checked property
6:31
we recently learned about if statements
6:33
we will first check the checked property
6:35
of the Subscribe button we'll place it
6:37
within an if statement
6:40
so to create a if statement it's if
6:42
parentheses curly braces
6:44
we are examining my checkbox that's the
6:47
Subscribe button
6:48
Dot
6:50
checked property this will evaluate to
6:53
be true or false
6:55
if this is true we will execute this
6:57
code
6:58
if not we do something else if somebody
7:00
is subscribed let's change the text
7:03
content of our sub result paragraph
7:06
so sub result
7:08
we are accessing the text
7:10
content
7:12
to equal
7:14
maybe I'll use a template literal
7:18
you are subscribed
7:25
else the user is not subscribed
7:29
let's copy this line paste it
7:32
you are not subscribed
7:35
Let's test this
7:37
if I click on the check box then press
7:39
the submit button it states that I am
7:41
subscribed you are subscribed if I were
7:44
to refresh the page I don't click the
7:47
Subscribe button press submit you are
7:49
not subscribed alright we know that that
7:51
works let's move on to the radio buttons
7:55
first we will check to see if somebody
7:57
selected Visa
7:59
we are accessing the Visa radio button
8:02
if Visa button
8:05
dot checked if this is true
8:08
we are changing the text of the payment
8:10
result paragraph
8:12
paymentresult dot text
8:15
content equals
8:18
you are paying with
8:21
Visa
8:27
let's see if that works
8:29
I'll select Visa press submit you are
8:32
paying with Visa
8:35
all right let's add
8:37
else if
8:40
the next radio button is Mastercard
8:41
button if this is checked MasterCard
8:45
button dot checked
8:48
then we will change the text content of
8:50
the payment result to be you are paying
8:52
with
8:54
MasterCard
8:58
you are paying with MasterCard
9:01
let's add another else if statement
9:03
else if
9:05
this time we are examining the PayPal
9:08
button
9:09
PayPal button dot checked if this is
9:13
true change the text content of the
9:16
payment result to be you are paying with
9:19
PayPal
9:22
you are paying with PayPal
9:25
else if none of these radio buttons are
9:27
checked
9:29
we will change the text content of the
9:32
payment result to be
9:36
you must select a payment type
9:43
I will press submit without selecting a
9:45
payment type
9:46
you must select a payment type
conclusion
9:49
all right everybody so that is the
9:50
checked property by examining the
9:53
checked property of an HTML checkbox or
9:55
a radio button element we can determine
9:58
if those elements are checked or not and
10:01
well that is the checked property in
10:03
JavaScript
