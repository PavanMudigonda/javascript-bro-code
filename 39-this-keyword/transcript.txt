hey so we got to talk about this this is
0:02
a keyword it's a reference to the object
0:05
where this is used the object depends on
0:08
the immediate context if we had a person
0:11
object and we're accessing their name
0:13
property we could replace person with
0:16
this as long as we're within the context
0:18
of that person object we'll create an
0:21
object const person
0:24
one let's add a property for name the
0:28
name will be SpongeBob
0:31
and a favorite food property fave food
0:35
SpongeBob likes hamburgers more
0:38
specifically crabby
0:39
patties I will give SpongeBob a say
0:42
hello method this will be a
0:46
function all we're going to do is
0:49
console.log I'll use a template
0:52
string hi I am I'll use a placeholder
0:57
let's attempt to use person one's name
1:00
let's see what
1:02
happens let's take our object of person
1:05
one I will invoke their say hello method
1:09
let's see what happens hello I am and
1:13
there's nothing here for the name inside
1:15
of this object of person one if I would
1:18
like to access one of these properties
1:20
I'm going to precede the property with
1:23
this this dot the name of the property
1:27
and that should work hi I'm SpongeBob
1:30
we're using this within the context of
1:33
person one it would be like us saying
1:36
person one. name there would be no
1:39
difference this is a reference to the
1:41
object we within if I said this do
1:45
favorite food well fave food for short
1:48
hi I am
1:49
hamburgers it would be like us saying
1:52
person onef food let's add another
1:56
method I will add an eat
1:58
method
2:03
let's
2:05
console.log I'll use another template
2:08
string add a
2:10
placeholder
2:13
this.name is eating add another
2:17
placeholder this. fave
2:21
food let's have person one use their eat
2:25
method SpongeBob is eating hamburgers
2:29
the cool thing about the this keyword is
2:31
that if we create a new object with
2:33
these same methods we'll use the second
2:35
object's properties let's copy person
2:39
one paste change person one to person
2:42
two the name for person two will be
2:45
Patrick favorite food will be
2:48
Pizza let's have person two use their
2:52
eat
2:53
method SpongeBob is eating hamburgers
2:56
Patrick is eating pizza since we're in
2:58
the context of person 2 now imagine
3:01
we're replacing this with person
3:04
two person 2.n name Person 2. fave
3:08
food if you were to use this outside of
3:11
any objects I'm going to console.log
3:16
this what we're returned with is a
3:18
window object basically we're returning
3:21
the window to see our website
3:24
technically we're inside of an object
3:26
already our window object and we have
3:29
all of these
3:31
properties but since we're using the
3:33
this keyword inside the context of
3:35
person one and person two we'll instead
3:37
make a reference to those objects hey
3:40
one thing I forgot to mention the this
3:42
keyword doesn't work with arrow
3:44
functions for example with person two
3:47
let's convert this to an arrow
3:54
function blank is eating undefined when
3:57
you use this within an arrow function
4:00
it's making a reference to that window
4:01
object still our window object does have
4:04
a name that's why it's appearing empty
4:06
but fave food is undefined because our
4:08
window object doesn't have a favorite
4:10
food property all right everybody so
4:12
that is the this keyword we will be
4:14
using this keyword a lot all it is is a
4:17
reference a reference to the object
4:19
where this is used and that is the this
4:22
keyword in
4:25
