hey people let's do this thing so the
0:02
static keyword static is a keyword that
0:04
defines Properties or methods that
0:06
belong to a class itself rather than the
0:09
objects created from that class in
0:11
summary a class owns anything static not
0:15
the objects so what we're going to do is
0:17
create a class for math
0:19
utilities class math util for
0:24
short we'll create our own version of Pi
0:27
we'll use the static keyword the name
0:30
will be Pi Pi will equal
0:33
3.14159 just the first few
0:36
digits I'm going to zoom in a little if
0:39
I would like the static property I have
0:41
to access it by its class so let's
0:45
console.
0:47
log the name of the class math util dot
0:52
the name of the property Pi our static
0:55
property is
0:57
3.14159 I don't need to create an object
0:59
object in order to use this property I
1:02
don't have to type const math UIL 1
1:07
equals new math
1:10
util I would have to type math util one
1:13
that's the name of this object in order
1:15
to access Pi all I have to do is type
1:17
the name of the
1:18
class and that's pretty convenient
1:21
anything declared as static belongs to
1:23
the class itself and not any object
1:26
created from that class so now we're
1:28
going to create a static method
1:31
we'll use the static keyword we'll get a
1:34
diameter once we pass in a radius as an
1:36
argument get
1:39
diameter we have one parameter a
1:42
radius all we're going to do is return
1:46
radius time
1:49
2 okay let's
1:52
console.log again we have to type the
1:54
name of the class matthu till dot the
1:58
name of the method get
2:00
diameter we have to pass in a radius
2:02
though let's pass in
2:04
10 our diameter is 20 let's create a new
2:09
static method for get
2:11
circumference get
2:15
circumference the formula is going to be
2:19
we will be returning 2
2:23
* this meaning Matthew
2:26
till.
2:28
pi
2:30
times the radius we
2:33
receive let's
2:37
console.log let me make the C
2:39
Capital the name of the class math util
2:43
dot get
2:45
circumference pass in a
2:48
radius the circumference is
2:51
62.83 let's create one more for get
2:55
area static get area we need a r
3:01
radius we will
3:05
return this
3:08
Pi time
3:10
radius time radius so that's radius
3:17
squared
3:18
console.log matthu till the name of the
3:20
class get area pass in 10 and the area
3:25
is
3:28
31415 in the next example we'll have a
3:30
mix of regular properties and methods
3:32
and static properties and methods this
3:35
will be example
3:37
two we'll create a class of users class
3:43
user we'll create a static variable to
3:46
keep track of the amount of users we
3:49
create user count I will set that equal
3:52
to
3:54
zero I'll include a
3:57
Constructor let me just space this out a
3:59
little
4:01
our Constructor is going to be
4:02
automatically called when we instantiate
4:05
a new object we need one argument though
4:07
when we create a new user we need a
4:10
username once we have our username we
4:13
will assign this do username equals
4:18
username not only that but when we
4:20
create a new user I'm going to increase
4:22
our user count by one just so we can
4:26
keep track of how many users we create
4:28
so inside the constru RoR you can write
4:30
additional code it's not only for
4:32
assigning
4:33
properties let's take
4:36
user. user
4:39
count Plus+ to increment
4:42
it let's create some user
4:45
objects const user one equals new user
4:50
pass in a username I'll pass in
4:55
SpongeBob then let's
4:58
console.log user one's
5:02
username which is
5:05
SpongeBob let's attempt to access user
5:08
one's user
5:10
count with user one's user count we get
5:13
undefined that's because our user
5:16
doesn't have user count as a property
5:18
it's static that means it belongs to the
5:21
class not any objects created from the
5:23
class to access user count we have to
5:26
type the name of the
5:27
class user in this case
5:30
we have one
5:32
user let's see what happens when I
5:34
create a new user
5:35
object user 2 will
5:38
equal
5:40
Patrick our user count is now two let's
5:44
display user 2's
5:45
name yep we have SpongeBob and Patrick
5:48
the total user count is
5:50
two let's create a third
5:52
user user three will be
5:57
Sandy console.log
6:00
user 3.
6:02
username our user count is now
6:05
three we have a static property that's
6:08
keeping track of the amount of users we
6:10
create let's create a method the first
6:13
one will not be static say
6:16
hello all we're going to do is
6:21
console.log I'll use a template
6:24
string hello my
6:27
username is add a
6:30
placeholder this do
6:35
username let's have user one use there
6:40
say hello
6:42
method same thing with user two and user
6:48
three hello my username is
6:50
SpongeBob Patrick and Sandy now we'll
6:54
create a static method we'll get the
6:57
user
6:58
count get
7:00
user
7:03
count
7:06
console.log I'll use a template
7:10
string there are I'll add a
7:14
placeholder
7:16
user. user
7:21
count users
7:24
online now in order to access this
7:26
method I have to type the name of the
7:28
class
7:29
user. getet user
7:34
count oops and I can't console. log that
7:38
user. getet user
7:40
count there are three users online all
7:44
right everybody so that is the static
7:45
keyword it defines properties and
7:47
methods that belong to a class itself
7:50
rather than any objects created from
7:51
that class in summary the class owns
7:54
anything static not the objects and well
7:58
that is the static keyword in
8:01
