0:00
all right so uh yeah type conversion
0:02
type conversion is the process of
0:04
changing the data type of a value to
0:07
another data type for example we can
0:09
convert strings to numbers numbers to
0:11
booleans booleans to Strings numbers to
0:13
strings booleans to numbers I think you
0:15
get the idea why might we want to do
0:17
this well when we accept user input the
0:20
data type of that input is a string if
0:22
we need to use it for any sort of math
0:24
we need to convert it to a number here's
0:26
an example let's say we have variable
0:28
age I will create a window prompt window
0:31
dot prompt
0:33
we will ask a user how old are you
0:38
I'm going to add 1 to our age age plus
0:41
equals one
0:43
then console.log
0:46
age
0:48
how old are you let's say I'm 25 press
0:50
OK let's inspect our page go to console
0:54
it shows that age is 251.
0:57
when we accept user input it's a string
0:59
data type a series of characters by
1:02
adding one we appended one to the end of
1:04
our string we're not increasing our age
1:07
by one we're doing string concatenation
1:09
we are going to convert our user input
1:12
into a number and this is how
1:15
so after accepting our user input and
1:18
before making any changes to it let's
1:20
reassign age equal to and this is a
1:23
function the number function it will
1:26
convert another data type such as a
1:28
string or Boolean into a number then
1:30
we'll place our Edge variable within
1:32
that function
1:34
so now this should work
1:36
how old are you let's say I'm 25 press
1:38
ok 26.
1:40
so that's the reason you may want to
1:42
type convert because different data
1:44
types behave differently along with my
1:47
age variable I'm going to display the
1:50
type of age what's the data type
1:53
how old are you 25 press OK 26 and it
1:57
shows that the data type of age is
1:59
number if we removed this type
2:01
conversion
2:03
and then run this again
2:05
it shows that our age is 251 and it's a
2:09
string which is not exactly what we
2:11
would like that's a reason why type
2:13
conversion is important let me give you
2:15
another example let's create three
2:16
variables let X let y
2:21
and let Z I'll show you what happens
2:23
when we convert different values into
2:25
different data types let's say x is the
2:29
word Pizza
2:31
same thing with y and z
2:35
I will type Cast X as a number
2:39
then we need to place X within the
2:41
number function I kind of want to see
2:43
what happens when we try and convert
2:45
pizza into a number
2:47
it's probably not going to go well
2:49
let's convert Y into a string
2:54
then Z will be a Boolean
3:01
let's console DOT log
3:05
X as well as the type of x
3:11
let's do the same thing with y and z
3:18
alright what's gonna happen
3:21
if you attempt to convert alphabetical
3:24
characters into a number
3:25
that variable will be Nan which means
3:29
not a number the data type is still
3:31
number though as you can see
3:33
the word Pizza is already a string so
3:35
converting it into a string really
3:37
doesn't do anything that's why for this
3:39
line the value is still pizza and the
3:42
data type is still a string if you
3:45
convert a string into a Boolean booleans
3:47
again are either true or false
3:49
converting the word pizza into a Boolean
3:51
returns true and the data type is
3:54
Boolean so basically as long as there's
3:56
some value here and you convert it into
3:58
a Boolean it will always be true
4:01
let's replace pizza with zero
4:05
what will happen
4:07
we can convert 0 into a number
4:10
it doesn't contain any alphabetical
4:11
characters
4:13
X contains zero it's a number
4:16
Y is zero but it's treated as a string
4:19
Z contains true
4:22
and it's a Boolean what about empty
4:24
strings
4:25
just a set of quotes
4:27
typecasting an empty string is a number
4:29
is still zero
4:31
we have an empty string for y
4:33
then with our Boolean it's false why
4:36
might you want to type cast a string as
4:38
a Boolean that's one way in which you
4:40
can check to see if user input is empty
4:43
like did somebody type something in if a
4:45
user skipped user input it's most likely
4:47
going to be an empty string then you can
4:49
check to see like if this is false then
4:52
the user didn't type in anything and you
4:54
can let them know
4:55
what about a variable that's declared
4:57
but not assigned a value
5:00
converting an undefined variable to a
5:03
number results in not a number
5:05
our string is undefined
5:08
and our Boolean variable returns false
5:10
so that's the basics of type conversion
5:12
it's the process of changing the data
5:15
type of a value to another it's pretty
5:16
important when you accept user input
5:18
because when you accept user input it's
5:20
a string data type at times you may want
5:22
to convert it to a number if you need to
5:24
include that number with any sort of
5:26
arithmetic expressions or a Boolean if
5:28
you're checking to see if that user
5:30
input was completed
5:32
we'll have more practice with this in
5:33
the future and well that is type
5:35
conversion in JavaScript
