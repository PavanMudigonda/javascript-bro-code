0:01
to show you how we can show and hide an
0:04
HTML element using JavaScript in this
0:06
video you'll need an image to work with
0:09
once you find your image add it to your
0:11
website folder then we are ready to
0:13
begin we're going to create a button and
0:16
an image element let's start with the
0:18
button the text on the button will be
0:21
initially hide to hide an element I will
0:24
give this button a unique
0:26
ID of my
0:28
button I'll add a break then we'll
0:32
create an image
0:33
element this is a self-closing tag with
0:36
this image I will set the source equal
0:39
to either the relative file path or the
0:42
file
0:44
name so my file is car.jpg
0:48
it's a little too big I'll set the width
0:51
attribute to be like 400 pixels that's a
0:55
decent size I will give this image a
0:57
unique ID of my image my IMG and just so
1:03
we can see this button I'm going to
1:05
apply a little bit of CSS to the button
1:08
let's select the ID of my button take
1:11
the font size I will set it to be 2
1:15
RM that's decent enough all right let's
1:19
go to our Javascript file I'm going to
1:22
create a reference to my button and my
1:24
image let's start with the button const
1:27
my button equals
1:30
document. getet element by ID the ID
1:35
that I'm selecting is my
1:38
button let's create a reference to my
1:41
image as well my IMG the ID was my
1:47
IMG when I click on this button I would
1:50
like to do something we will take my
1:52
button and add an event
1:55
listener add event
1:58
listener there are two arguments an
2:01
event type and a call back to a
2:04
function the event type is going to be
2:06
click when we click on the button we're
2:08
going to do something for the Callback
2:11
we'll write an arrow function we are
2:14
provided with an event parameter by the
2:16
web browser Arrow do this when we click
2:20
on the button what code do we want to
2:22
perform we're going to take my image
2:25
access its style access its display
2:28
property set it to be a string of none
2:32
so when you click on the button it's
2:34
going to hide the image the display
2:36
property is set to none not only that
2:39
let's change the text on the button
2:41
after we hide the element let's take my
2:45
button change the text content equal to
2:49
be show because now I want to show the
2:53
element so hide BEC
2:56
show when we click on the button a
2:58
second time nothing nothing
3:00
happens we would like to toggle between
3:02
hiding and displaying this element we'll
3:05
write an if statement let's check to see
3:08
if the display of my image is strictly
3:12
equal to
3:13
none is the display of my image
3:16
currently none if so we're going to set
3:18
the display to block because it's a
3:20
block level element take my image access
3:24
its style access its display property
3:28
set it to be
3:31
BL then within an lse
3:33
statement place these two lines of
3:40
code and we will change the text content
3:43
of my button to be
3:46
hide now when clicking the button we can
3:49
toggle between hiding and showing this
3:51
element the
3:53
image now let me demonstrate something
3:56
if we were to take my button then add it
3:59
after the
4:00
image here's what would
4:03
happen let me add a break
4:07
to so by setting the display To None we
4:11
don't Reserve any space for that image
4:13
my button moves up near the top of the
4:15
window until I show it again another
4:18
option if we would like to reserve some
4:20
space for the image is to toggle the
4:23
visibility not the display property
4:25
replace display with
4:28
visibility
4:32
we're going to check if the visibility
4:35
is
4:37
hidden set the visibility equal to be
4:41
hidden if we would like to show the
4:43
image the visibility is going to be set
4:45
to
4:47
visible when we toggle the visibility of
4:50
this image we at least reserve the space
4:52
for it the elements that come after
4:54
aren't going to shift near the top of
4:56
the
4:57
window you can use visibility or display
4:59
depending on the project you're creating
5:01
all right everybody so that is how to
5:03
show and hide HTML elements using
5:09
JavaScript
