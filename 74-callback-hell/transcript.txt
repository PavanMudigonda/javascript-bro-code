hey everybody in today's video I got to
0:01
introduce to you the wonderful world of
0:03
callback hell callback hell is a
0:06
situation in JavaScript where callbacks
0:08
are nested within other callbacks to the
0:11
degree where the code is difficult to
0:13
read if you Nest too many callbacks
0:15
within other callbacks your code starts
0:17
to form a pyramid and it's really
0:19
difficult to work with callback hell is
0:21
an old pattern to handle asynchronous
0:23
functions in JavaScript nowadays we have
0:25
promises as well as a sync and a wait to
0:27
avoid callback hell which we'll discuss
0:29
pretty soon to help us avoid callback
0:31
hell we should be familiar with what it
0:33
is I'm going to create four tasks these
0:36
will be functions function task
0:40
one these will be synchronous functions
0:43
we don't need to use callbacks for
0:44
synchronous functions then we'll change
0:46
these to be asyrus functions within task
0:49
one we will
0:51
console.log task one
0:53
complete okay let's copy task one paste
0:56
it three times for a total of four
0:58
tasks we'll have task
1:02
two task three and task
1:06
four in order from the top down we will
1:09
execute task one followed by task
1:13
two task
1:16
three and task four when all four tasks
1:20
are complete we will
1:24
console.log all tasks
1:27
complete these functions work
1:29
synchronously they're all in order task
1:31
one is complete then two three then four
1:35
then we get the final message of all
1:36
tasks complete but what if these were
1:38
asynchronous functions they're not going
1:40
to follow this order from the top down
1:42
so to make these functions asynchronous
1:44
one thing we could do we can enclose
1:46
this code within the set timeout
1:48
function set
1:50
timeout set timeout takes two arguments
1:54
a call back and a time in milliseconds
1:56
in which to complete this code for the
1:58
call back this could be a call back an
2:00
anonymous function or an arrow function
2:02
I'll write an arrow function parameters
2:05
Arrow do
2:06
this say the task is complete after
2:11
2,000 milliseconds let's do this with
2:13
the other tasks
2:17
too so task two will be complete after 1
2:21
second 1,000
2:23
milliseconds task three will be complete
2:26
after 3,000
2:28
milliseconds now task 4 4 task 4 will be
2:31
complete after
2:33
1,500 milliseconds okay let's try this
2:36
again I need these tasks to be completed
2:39
in order starting from one all the way
2:41
to
2:42
four it says that the tasks are already
2:45
complete then the tasks are completed in
2:47
this order task 2 task 4 task one and
2:50
task three so that's the problem with
2:52
asynchronous code asynchronous functions
2:55
can complete at any time the rest of our
2:57
program doesn't wait around for them to
2:59
finish if I absolutely need these tasks
3:02
to complete an order starting with 1
3:04
then 2 3 4 each of these functions can
3:07
accept a call back so we need to set up
3:09
that
3:10
parameter after we say that that task is
3:13
complete we will execute the call back
3:15
to the next function so let's do this
3:17
with the rest of the
3:28
tasks
3:34
if we need these tasks to complete an
3:36
order starting with one we would take
3:38
one and there's one parameter a call
3:41
back we'll pass in a call back to task
3:43
two we can pass in a call back in a
3:45
nonos function or an arrow function I
3:47
like Arrow functions though parameters
3:50
Arrow do this what are we going to do
3:53
when task one is complete we'll call
3:55
task two task two also accepts a call
3:58
back again again this can be a callback
4:00
an anonymous function or an arrow
4:02
function this will be an arrow function
4:05
parameters Arrow do this what do we want
4:07
to do when task two is complete call
4:10
task three task three also accepts a
4:12
call back we'll use an arrow function
4:15
parameters Arrow do this now when task
4:18
three is complete guess what we're going
4:19
to do call task
4:22
four task four task four accepts a call
4:25
back we'll do this parameters Arrow then
4:29
I would like to
4:31
console.log all tasks complete all tasks
4:37
complete this should work
4:41
now task one complete task two
4:44
complete task three complete task four
4:47
complete all tasks complete so what
4:50
we've done is use callback hell it's
4:52
where you're nesting callbacks inside of
4:54
other callbacks if you have a lot of
4:56
tasks to complete an order it can become
4:58
very unmanageable
5:00
hey this is bro from the future one
5:02
thing that I wanted to mention is that
5:04
four levels of callbacks isn't too
5:06
unreasonable but when you add additional
5:08
levels on top of that that's when you're
5:10
starting to approach the levels of
5:11
callback hell where the code can become
5:13
unmanageable and really difficult to
5:15
read what I've written in this video
5:17
isn't too unreasonable but hopefully you
5:19
can see how we've come to start that
5:20
pyramid pattern that is all all right
5:23
everybody so that is callback hell it's
5:25
a situation in JavaScript where
5:27
callbacks are nested within other
5:28
callbacks where the code is difficult to
5:30
read it's an old pattern to handle
5:32
asynchronous functions in some upcoming
5:35
videos we'll be discussing promises as
5:37
well as a sync and a wait to avoid
5:38
callback hell and well everybody that is
5:41
callback hell and why you should avoid
5:42
it in
5:47
JavaScript
