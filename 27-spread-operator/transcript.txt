hey everybody today I'm going to explain
0:01
the spread operator in JavaScript the
0:04
spread operator is represented by three
0:06
dots the spread operator allows an
0:08
iterable such as an array or string to
0:11
be expanded in separate elements what
0:13
this does is unpack the elements here's
0:16
an example let's create an array of
0:19
numbers pick some numbers I'll just pick
0:21
1 through five 1 2 3 4 5 then just to
0:27
test this let's console.log
0:30
my array
0:32
numbers in this array what if I would
0:34
like to find the greatest value well one
0:37
way in which I could do that is let's
0:39
declare a maximum let maximum this is
0:42
going to be a variable equals I will use
0:46
the max method of math what would happen
0:49
if I place our array within this
0:51
method then I will display our
0:55
maximum so we have not a number using
0:58
the max method we can't place an array
1:00
directly within this method however by
1:02
utilizing the spread operator we can
1:04
spread this array into different
1:06
elements so we will preedee this array
1:09
with the spread operator we are going to
1:12
unpack the elements now if I run this
1:14
program again we have our result of five
1:17
when you use the spread operator imagine
1:19
that you're opening a box and taking out
1:21
all the contents inside like you're
1:23
unpacking something let's find the
1:25
minimum this time let minimum equals
1:31
math.min we will pass our array of
1:35
numbers then use the spread operator to
1:38
spread our array into different elements
1:40
what is the minimum value from this
1:42
array that would be one you can also do
1:45
this with strings too you can separate a
1:47
string into different
1:49
characters let let's create a username
1:53
equals type your name first name and
1:56
last name I will create an array name
1:59
named letters letters
2:02
equals we'll create a new array let's
2:05
take our username it's a string and use
2:08
the spread
2:09
operator then I will display our letters
2:14
console.log
2:17
letters and here's my name divided into
2:20
different characters what we have is an
2:21
array of characters with my array of
2:24
characters I can join them back together
2:26
and insert characters between each
2:28
element I will meth chain the join
2:30
method after our
2:32
array we'll add a dash between each
2:36
character so now my username is all one
2:39
string but there's a dash between each
2:42
character okay now this time we're going
2:44
to create an array of fruits we'll make
2:46
a shallow copy of an array using the
2:48
spread
2:50
operator add some fruit I'll add an
2:53
apple an
2:55
orange and a
2:57
banana then I will console
3:00
dolog my
3:03
fruits I can create a shallow copy of
3:06
this array using the spread operator a
3:08
shallow copy means it's a different data
3:10
structure but it contains identical
3:13
values I'll create a copy of fruits
3:16
named new fruits
3:20
equals an
3:22
array let's take our fruits array then
3:25
use the spread
3:27
operator let's display new fruits and it
3:30
should be an identical copy yep there's
3:33
no apparent change we have two different
3:36
arrays but they contain identical
3:38
elements we can combine two or more
3:41
arrays using the spread
3:43
operator let's create an array of
3:48
vegetables let's add some
3:50
carrots
3:53
celery
3:56
potatoes I'll rename new fruits as Foods
4:00
let's add our array of fruits we're
4:03
spreading
4:04
it comma then we will spread our
4:08
vegetables
4:09
array then we will display our array
4:12
Foods this array contains all of the
4:14
elements from these two arrays fruits
4:17
and vegetables we can use the spread
4:19
operator to combine arrays we even have
4:21
the capability to append separate
4:23
elements along with unpacking these
4:25
arrays I will also add eggs and
4:31
milk we have all of the elements from
4:34
our two arrays plus a few extras eggs
4:37
and milk all right everybody so that's
4:39
the spread operator it's three dots it
4:41
allows an iterable such as an array or
4:44
string to be expanded into separate
4:46
elements and well everybody that is the
4:49
spread operator in
4:52
JavaScript
