hey what's going on everybody so in
0:01
today's video I'm going to show you a
0:03
few ways in which we can format currency
0:05
in JavaScript it involves this pretty
0:07
sweet method the two local string method
0:10
basically what this method does is that
0:11
it returns a string with a language
0:14
sensitive representation of a number
0:17
depending on which country you're in you
0:18
format numbers a different way for
0:20
example I'm in the United States we
0:22
separate every thousand's place with a
0:24
comma then follow any decimal numbers on
0:26
the right hand side however if you were
0:28
in let's say Germany you would format it
0:31
this way personally I have no idea how
0:33
to read this number sorry Germany
0:35
representing numbers to a foreign
0:37
audience is fairly important because
0:39
honestly if I saw this number it would
0:41
confuse me now in today's video we're
0:43
going to be covering the two local
0:45
string method another way to format
0:47
currency is with international number
0:49
format but that's a little Advanced for
0:51
us once you're at the intermediate or
0:53
advanced level I would definitely take a
0:55
look at international number format but
0:57
that will be outside the scope of
0:58
today's lesson the two local string
1:00
method is a simple and beginner friendly
1:02
way to format currency and other numbers
1:05
so you have a number numbers have a
1:07
built-in two local string method the
1:10
first argument is a string
1:11
representation of a location a local it
1:14
specifies the language to use if you set
1:17
this to be undefined you'll use the
1:19
default set in the viewer's browser
1:21
that's a good option for the second
1:23
argument you can send an object an
1:26
object of formatting options I'll give
1:29
you an example
1:31
let's say we have a number let number
1:34
equal 1 2 3 4 5
1:37
6
1:40
789 to format this number I will take
1:43
our number reassign it equal to number
1:47
use the builtin to local string method
1:53
we have two arguments a string location
1:56
and an object let's start with the
1:58
string location for a United States
2:01
local that would be n for
2:04
english-us Capital then we should
2:07
display our number
2:09
console.log
2:11
number yep and there is United States
2:14
formatting let's pass in a string local
2:17
for
2:17
India again following the same
2:21
format we will change the location to be
2:25
hi for Hindi Das I in based on that
2:30
geographic location there's different
2:32
number
2:33
formatting let's cover
2:37
Germany
2:38
D- capital
2:41
de to use the viewer's default set for
2:44
the browser you're going to pass in
2:49
undefined so I will pass in
2:52
undefined for me personally that will
2:54
give me the United States
2:56
formatting now you can pass in options
2:59
we can can take this number with this
3:00
formatting and give it a unit of
3:05
currency so again we're going to
3:07
reassign our number number equals number
3:10
use the built-in to local string method
3:15
my location will be the United States
3:17
feel free to pick a different one if you
3:19
would like the second argument is going
3:21
to be an object we need to set a curly
3:23
braces to represent an object objects
3:26
can have properties properties that hold
3:28
values if you need currency you will set
3:31
the style property you'll set the style
3:33
property to have a string value of
3:36
currency the next property would
3:39
be
3:41
currency colon I'm going to zoom out a
3:44
little bit for United States dollars
3:46
that would be USD and let's see what we
3:49
have there we go we have American
3:53
dollars with United States number
3:56
formatting let's do this with Indian
3:58
rupees so again number equals number to
4:04
local
4:07
string the local will be hi- I comma for
4:12
the next argument we're passing in an
4:14
object I'm going to zoom in
4:17
again the style property will be
4:22
currency We'll add another
4:24
property this property will be currency
4:28
colon space
4:31
for rupes that would be I
4:34
NR and here is our new number with
4:38
different currency
4:39
formatting okay then I think Germany
4:41
uses
4:43
zos number equals number to local
4:50
string what's the location Germany that
4:53
would be
4:55
d-de Capital comma space the next
4:59
argument is an
5:00
object the style property will be
5:05
currency the next property will be
5:11
currency and the currency is going to be
5:14
EU for
5:16
euros and that has appeared to work all
5:20
right everybody so that is a beginner
5:21
friendly way in which you can format
5:23
currency in
5:28
JavaScript
