hey what's going on everybody so today
0:01
I'm going to explain variable scope in
0:04
JavaScript variable scope is where a
0:06
variable is recognized and accessible in
0:09
this beginner's tutorial we'll be
0:10
discussing the differences between a
0:12
local scope and a global scope suppose
0:14
we have a variable let x equals one each
0:18
variable name needs to be unique within
0:21
that scope I couldn't declare another
0:23
variable named X
0:24
where I set x t equal to if I were to
0:27
run this we have a syntax error
0:29
identifier X has already been declared
0:31
you can reuse the same variable names in
0:34
your program as long as they're within
0:36
different scopes
0:37
to demonstrate let's create two
0:39
functions function Function One within
0:42
function one we will declare a variable
0:44
x x equals one then we will console.log
0:49
whatever X is
0:51
then let's create function 2 by copying
0:54
function one and then paste it
0:57
function 2 x will equal 2. console.log x
1:03
if I were to invoke function 1
1:06
x equals one
1:08
if I were to invoke function 2 well x
1:11
equals two
1:13
so we have two variables with the same
1:15
name in our program
1:16
that's legal as long as they have
1:19
different scopes
1:20
any variable declared inside of a
1:22
function has a local scope or anytime
1:25
you declare a variable within a set of
1:27
curly braces there's no naming conflicts
1:30
because they're within different scopes
1:32
that way you can declare variables with
1:34
the same name which we've done with X
1:36
now functions can't see inside of other
1:39
functions within function 2 we will
1:42
declare variable y equals two
1:45
then console.log X within function 1 we
1:49
will console.log why
1:52
if I were to invoke function 1 we have
1:55
an uncaught reference error Y is not
1:57
defined at Function One
2:00
functions can't see inside of other
2:01
functions function one has no idea what
2:05
Y is we've declared that within another
2:07
function it's kind of like functions are
2:09
neighboring houses you can't necessarily
2:12
see inside of your neighbor's house
2:14
function 1 has no idea what variable Y
2:17
is likewise function 2 if I were to
2:20
invoke it function 2 has no idea what x
2:23
is
2:23
each of these variables are declared
2:26
inside of a function so they have a
2:28
local scope
2:29
a global scope for a variable is any
2:31
variable declared outside of a function
2:33
with function 1 let's get rid of x
2:38
and we will console.log X function two
2:41
we will get rid of y console.log x
2:45
if I were to declare a variable outside
2:47
of these functions let x equal 3.
2:51
I'll invoke function 1 will display X
2:54
is 3 Let's invoke function two axis 3.
2:58
any variable declared outside of a
3:01
function has a global scope it's
3:03
available through the whole program a
3:06
global variable is recognized and
3:08
accessible from anywhere
3:09
hey this is bro from the future I was
3:12
editing this video and I thought of a
3:14
really good analogy for Global variables
3:16
let's say that a function is a house we
3:19
live in function one and our neighbor
3:21
lives in function two we can see inside
3:23
of function one but we can't see inside
3:26
of our neighbor's house at function two
3:28
anything that's declared in the global
3:30
scope isn't found within any houses it's
3:33
outside everybody can plainly see it
3:35
it's kind of like a creepy stalker
3:37
that's under a street light at three in
3:39
the morning everybody while inside of
3:41
their house can still see everything
3:42
outside that's an analogy I thought was
3:44
kind of accurate to describe a global
3:46
scope however it's not recommended to
3:48
declare Global variables in a large
3:50
program just because you can have naming
3:53
conflicts in a large program I might
3:55
accidentally reuse the variable X or
3:57
change it somewhere X is a very common
4:00
name for a variable so in a large
4:01
program I would stick with local
4:03
variables but in a small program like
4:06
this it's fine when inside of a function
4:08
we'll use any a local instance of a
4:11
variable first if it's not found we'll
4:13
look at the global scope So within
4:15
Function One let's declare X to be one
4:19
within function 2 will declare X to B2
4:24
and then within the global scope we have
4:26
x equals three if I were to declare
4:29
function one do you think X will equal
4:31
one or three
4:33
well it's one
4:35
if we have two variables with the same
4:37
name and they're in different Scopes
4:39
we'll use the local version first that's
4:42
why X is one and not three if I were to
4:45
invoke function two well x equals two
4:48
if these local variables weren't
4:50
available
4:52
we would use the global version instead
4:54
where x equals three
4:57
all right everybody so that is variable
4:59
scope it's where a variable is
5:01
recognized and accessible you have a
5:03
local scope that's any time a variable
5:05
is declared within a set of curly braces
5:07
that variable is then only accessible to
5:11
anything within that set of curly braces
5:13
and a global scope is where a variable
5:15
is declared outside of any functions
5:17
it's available throughout the whole
5:19
program and well everybody that is
5:21
variable scope in JavaScript
