hey what's going on everybody in today's
0:01
video I'm going to discuss objects in
0:03
JavaScript an object is a collection of
0:06
related properties and or methods
0:09
properties are things that an object has
0:12
such as a first name or an age a method
0:15
is a function that belongs to an object
0:18
for example I have a person object our
0:20
person can say hello and they can say by
0:23
methods are just functions that belong
0:25
to an object what can this object do
0:28
objects can represent Real World objects
0:31
such as people products or places in
0:33
this example we'll be creating some
0:35
people objects people from the show
0:37
SpongeBob we'll start from scratch
0:40
though we'll create a person object I'll
0:42
use a constant although it's not
0:44
necessary const person equals then add a
0:49
set of curly
0:50
braces we'll start with any properties
0:53
you can add as many properties as you
0:54
would like they're in key value pairs
0:57
this person will have a first name key
0:59
key colon then some value this person's
1:03
first name will be SpongeBob separate
1:06
each key value pair with a comma let's
1:09
include a last name property last name
1:12
colon space will be Square Pants add a
1:16
comma when you're done with this key
1:17
value pair We'll add an age property of
1:21
30 age has a different data type it's a
1:24
number the first two in my example were
1:26
both strings SpongeBob and Square Pants
1:30
let's add a Boolean is
1:33
employed colon space I will set that to
1:36
be true he has a job at the K crusty
1:38
crab okay that's good enough for now I
1:41
would like to access these properties
1:43
let's
1:44
console. log if I need one of these
1:47
properties take the object you're
1:49
referring to in this case person dot the
1:52
name of the property let's do first name
1:55
person. first name property that would
1:58
give me SpongeBob let's do this with
2:00
last name take the object name dot the
2:03
name of the
2:04
property person. last name is
2:08
SquarePants let's do this with age
2:11
person. AG is
2:14
30 person do is
2:17
employed is set to true all right let's
2:20
create another object we'll create an
2:22
object for
2:24
Patrick const person now objects can't
2:28
have the same name objects need
2:30
different names for example I can't have
2:32
two person objects they can't have the
2:35
same name syntax error identifier person
2:37
has already been declared I will rename
2:40
our first person as person one our
2:43
second person will be person two then
2:46
any place in which I'm referencing
2:47
person will now need to be person
2:51
one let's reuse these same key value
2:54
pairs person two's first name will be
2:58
Patrick his last last name will be star
3:02
Patrick will be I don't know how old he
3:04
is according to the TV series let's say
3:06
he's
3:07
42 is Patrick employed no he just
3:11
watches TV all day now I would like to
3:14
access person 2's
3:16
properties okay well
3:18
console.log person 2's first name Person
3:22
2's last name Person two is age person
3:25
two is
3:27
employed okay for person two we have
3:29
Patrick
3:30
star 42
3:32
false so those are properties of an
3:35
object they key value pairs add as many
3:38
as you would like in this example these
3:40
properties mimic real world attributes
3:42
that a person might have like a first
3:44
name last name age whatever you can
3:47
think of but not only that objects can
3:49
have dedicated functions that we refer
3:51
to as methods what sorts of actions can
3:54
these objects perform for example a
3:56
person could eat they could drink they
3:59
could sleep what sorts of things do
4:01
people do so just to keep this simple I
4:03
am going to create a function to say
4:06
hello we'll start with person
4:08
one say
4:11
hello colon space this will be a
4:14
function
4:15
expression what are we going to do when
4:19
we invoke this function let's
4:23
console.log what would SpongeBob say if
4:25
he's greeting somebody hi I'm
4:28
SpongeBob
4:31
be sure you're not including a semicolon
4:33
at the end that should work let's test
4:37
it I'm going to have person one invoke
4:42
their say hello
4:44
method hi I'm SpongeBob let's add a say
4:48
hello method to Patrick person
4:52
two we'll change the output of say hello
4:55
what would Patrick
4:56
say
4:58
hey
5:01
I'm Patrick dot dot dot now we'll have
5:04
person two use their say hello method
5:07
hey I'm Patrick you can add as many
5:10
methods as you would like so with these
5:12
functions we're using a function
5:14
expression if you prefer you could even
5:16
use an arrow
5:17
function list your
5:19
arguments Arrow then the code you would
5:22
like to
5:23
perform this would work
5:25
too let's add an eat method eat
5:31
function we'll use a function expression
5:33
for
5:35
SpongeBob let's
5:38
console.log what is SpongeBob eating I
5:42
am eating a crabby
5:45
patty we'll include a neat function for
5:48
Patrick as
5:49
well what's Patrick going to eat Patrick
5:52
is
5:53
eating I am
5:56
eating roast beef chicken
6:00
and
6:01
pizza and if you would like you can use
6:03
an arrow function for this
6:05
example list your parameters Arrow then
6:09
the code you would like to
6:11
perform it's not necessary but I do like
6:14
Arrow functions person one SpongeBob
6:17
will use his eat method same thing goes
6:20
with Patrick person two so SpongeBob is
6:23
eating a crabby patty Patrick is eating
6:26
roast beef chicken and Pizza all right
6:29
everybody so JavaScript objects are a
6:32
collection of related properties and or
6:35
methods properties are what an object
6:37
has methods are functions that an object
6:40
can perform they can represent Real
6:43
World objects such as people products or
6:46
places properties are key value pairs
6:49
methods are functions that belong to an
6:51
object and well everybody that is an
6:53
introduction to object-oriented
6:55
programming in
6:58
JavaScript
