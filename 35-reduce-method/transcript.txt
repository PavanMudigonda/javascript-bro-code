What's going on everybody? So, in
0:01
today's video, I got to explain the
0:03
reduce method in JavaScript. The reduce
0:06
method reduces the elements of an array
0:08
to a single value. In this example,
0:11
we'll create an array of prices as if it
0:13
was a shopping cart. We'll sum all of
0:16
the prices within our shopping cart and
0:18
return a total. We'll need an array to
0:20
work with. const prices equals an array.
0:24
Think of some prices. Type in anything
0:27
as long as it's a number. I'll keep this
0:29
simple and use whole numbers. I'll add
0:32
something that is $5, another that is
0:34
30, 10, 25,
0:37
15, and 20. We will create a variable
0:41
for a total const total equals take our
0:46
array of prices. We will use the
0:48
built-in reduce method of arrays. But we
0:51
do need to pass in a call back to a
0:53
function.
0:55
We need to create a function that will
0:56
sum all of these values.
0:59
Let's create a function to sum.
1:03
Our sum function will have two
1:05
parameters. The first will be an
1:07
accumulator.
1:09
The second will be the next element.
1:13
All we're going to do is return our
1:16
accumulator
1:17
plus our element. I'll explain how this
1:20
works momentarily. I just want to be
1:22
sure that everything runs fine first.
1:24
Within the reduce method, we'll pass in
1:26
a call back to the sum function that
1:28
will return a single value, a total in
1:31
this case. Let's see what our total is.
1:34
console.log.
1:36
I'll use a template string. Pick a unit
1:38
of currency. I'll pick American dollars.
1:41
Add a placeholder. Let's display our
1:44
total. So, my total is $15.
1:48
If you would like to add cents to the
1:50
end of that, you can follow this with
1:52
the two fixed method. Then add two
1:56
decimal places for cents. All right. So,
1:59
how does this work exactly? We have two
2:02
parameters, accumulator and element. It
2:05
might be easier if I were to rename
2:06
these parameters. You can rename
2:08
parameters. Let's say accumulator is the
2:12
previous element.
2:14
Element is the next element. We're
2:17
returning the previous element plus the
2:20
next element. During the first
2:22
iteration, our accumulator is five. The
2:25
next element is 30.
2:28
Then we are going to return the
2:30
accumulator plus 30, which is 35. We'll
2:35
return this to the accumulator during
2:37
the next iteration. The accumulator is
2:40
now 35. The next element is 10.
2:44
35 + 10 would give us 45. Return that to
2:49
the accumulator and add the next element
2:52
25. So you just follow that pattern.
2:59
All right, let's go over another
3:00
example.
3:02
We'll create an array of grades. const
3:05
grades equals these will be some number
3:08
grades. 75 50 90 80 65 and 95. We'll
3:17
find the maximum value from this array.
3:20
We'll create a constant to hold the
3:22
maximum value. What is the maximum
3:24
score? const maximum equals take our
3:28
grades array. Use the built-in reduce
3:30
method. Then we need to pass in a call
3:33
back to the reduce method. We need a
3:35
function to get max.
3:39
There's two parameters, an accumulator
3:43
and the next element. Like I said, feel
3:46
free to rename them. We will return the
3:49
max method of math. Math domax. Pass in
3:54
these two parameters accumulator and the
3:57
next element.
4:00
Within the reduce method, we'll pass in
4:02
a call back to get max.
4:05
The value returned will be the maximum
4:07
grade from this array. So let's
4:09
console.log
4:12
whatever the maximum is. The maximum
4:15
score from this array is 95.
4:19
Let's do this with the minimum.
4:21
Let's copy this function. Change any
4:24
instance of max to min.
4:27
get min math domin.
4:31
Let's create a new constant. const
4:34
minimum equals our array of grades. Use
4:38
the reduce method to return a single
4:41
value. Then pass in a call back to get
4:43
min. Let's console.log
4:48
the minimum.
4:51
The minimum score from this array is 50.
4:54
All right, everybody. That is the reduce
4:56
method. It's a built-in method of arrays
4:59
to reduce the elements of an array to a
5:01
single value. You can use it to sum the
5:04
elements of an array. Another
5:05
possibility is to find the minimum or
5:07
maximum value from an array. And well
5:10
everybody, that is the reduce method in
5:12
JavaScript.
