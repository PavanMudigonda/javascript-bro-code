hey what's good everybody so in today's
0:02
video I'm going to give you a lesson in
0:03
destructuring in JavaScript
0:05
destructuring allows us to extract
0:08
values from arrays and objects then
0:10
assign them to variables in a convenient
0:12
way we can use straight brackets to
0:14
perform array destructuring or curly
0:17
braces to perform object destructuring
0:19
I'll give you five different examples
swap the values of two variables
0:21
example one swap the value of two
0:24
variables we'll have let a equal 1 let b
0:29
equal
0:31
to use array D structuring we need a set
0:33
of straight
0:35
brackets add the variables a comma B
0:39
this will equal we're creating a new
0:41
array on the right hand side B comma a
0:45
on the left hand side of our equals
0:47
we're using destructuring on the right
0:49
hand side we're creating an array let's
0:51
see what's within variables A and B
0:54
console.log variable a then variable
0:58
B so if these values are swapped we
1:02
should have two then one not one and two
1:06
that's example one we can use
1:07
destructuring to swap the value of two
swap two elements in an array
1:11
variables example two we can swap two
1:13
elements in an array let's create an
1:16
array of
1:17
colors const colors equals an array pick
1:22
some colors I'll go with RGB so that
1:25
would be red
1:28
green blue
1:30
let's add black and
1:34
white suppose I would like to swap the
1:37
position of the first element and the
1:39
last element this first element has an
1:41
index of zero this particular last
1:44
element has an index of four again we're
1:46
going to use array to structuring we
1:48
need a set of straight brackets we'll
1:50
take our array colors at index of
1:55
zero comma array at index of four
2:00
we want to swap red with white 0 1 2 3 4
2:04
that's the fourth index equals we're
2:08
creating a new array by using Straight
2:10
brackets colors at index 4 comma colors
2:15
at
2:16
index0 then let's print our
2:18
array
2:21
console.log R array of
2:24
colors there we go we have white green
2:27
blue black red that's how we can use
2:30
destructuring to swap two elements in an
2:33
array example three we can assign array
assign array elements to variables
2:36
elements to variables we'll declare a
2:38
bunch of variables const we'll use
2:40
destructuring we're destructuring an
2:42
array we need a set of straight brackets
2:44
we'll create some variable names first
2:48
color Second
2:51
Color third
2:54
color I will assign this equal to our
2:58
array colors
3:01
let's print these
3:02
variables
3:04
console.log our first color we have
3:08
red second
3:10
color
3:12
green third
3:14
color blue you could combine a radi
3:18
structuring with rest parameters we have
3:21
two colors left let's assign that to a
3:23
new array we'll use rest parameters I
3:27
will name this array EXT ra
3:31
colors then we will
3:35
console.log extra colors and that should
3:38
be a new array that has the remaining
3:40
colors black and white that's how to
3:43
assign array elements to variables using
extract values from objects
3:47
destructuring example for extract values
3:50
from objects we'll create two people
3:53
objects const person
3:57
one person one will have a few
3:59
properties
4:00
first name will be
4:04
SpongeBob last name will be
4:10
SquarePants age will be 30 and a job
4:14
meaning
4:15
occupation not John
4:18
job his job is that he is a fry
4:21
cook all right let's copy person one
4:24
looks like that n should be capital in
4:26
last name all right let's copy person
4:29
one
4:30
paste it change person one to person two
4:34
the first name of person two will be
4:36
Patrick last name star age will be
4:41
34 person two is not going to have a job
4:43
property he's
4:45
unemployed using destructuring I can
4:48
extract values from these
4:50
objects we'll create a few variables
4:53
const we'll use object destructuring we
4:55
need a set of curly braces this time
4:58
we'll create these variables
5:00
first
5:01
name last name age and
5:06
job now this equals let's start with
5:09
person
5:10
one let's display these variables
5:16
console.log first name is
5:22
SpongeBob last name
5:26
SquarePants age 30
5:31
job fry cook let's do this with person
5:36
two Patrick Star his ages 34 person two
5:40
does not have a job property person one
5:43
does though our job variable is
5:45
undefined as you can see here you can
5:48
set default values when using
5:50
destructuring if somebody doesn't have a
5:52
job property we'll set job to equal
5:58
unemployed let's see if that works yep
6:01
Patrick Star age 34 his job is he's
6:04
unemployed that's how you can extract
6:06
values from objects values extracted can
6:09
even have default
destructuring in function parameters
6:11
values all right last example we can
6:13
destructure in function parameters we
6:16
can pass an object to a function and
6:19
destructure it when it's passed in let's
6:21
create a function we will create a
6:24
function to display a person
6:30
with the parameters we'll use
6:32
destructuring we're destructuring an
6:33
object we need a set of curly braces
6:36
we'll receive an object such as this I'm
6:40
going to invoke display person we'll
6:43
pass in person one as an argument when
6:47
we receive person one as an argument
6:49
we'll destructure that object right away
6:51
we will create a first name parameter
6:54
last
6:55
name age and
6:58
job all we'll do is print a few lines
7:01
using
7:02
console.log I'll use a template string
7:05
let's say Name colon space I'll add a
7:09
placeholder first
7:11
name and last
7:15
name let's add a new
7:20
line age call in space add a placeholder
7:25
age then lastly
7:28
job job colon space add a placeholder
7:32
job we're passing in person one and D
7:35
structuring it we should display name
7:38
SpongeBob SquarePants age 30 job fry
7:41
cook let's pass in person two as an
7:45
argument name Patrick Star age 34 job is
7:50
undefined again we can set a default
7:52
value when destructuring if an object
7:54
doesn't have a job property we will set
7:56
that equal to be unemploy
8:00
employed Patrick Star age 34 job
8:03
unemployed then if we pass in person one
8:06
again his job should not be unemployed
8:09
he's a fry cook there is a job property
8:12
so we do not use the default value all
8:14
right everybody so those are a few
8:16
examples of destructuring there's a lot
8:18
you can do with destructuring you use a
8:20
set of straight brackets to perform
8:22
array destructuring or curly braces for
8:24
object destructuring they allow you to
8:27
extract values from arrays an object
8:29
then assign them to variables in a
8:31
convenient way and well that is
8:33
destructuring in
8:39
JavaScript
