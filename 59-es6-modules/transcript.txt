hey what's going on everybody so today
0:01
I'm going to explain es6 modules in
0:04
JavaScript a module is an external file
0:07
that contains reusable code that can be
0:10
imported into other JavaScript files
0:13
let's say you write a really difficult
0:14
program well any part of that program
0:17
you can import into a different
0:18
application if you don't feel like
0:20
rewriting it modules can contain
0:22
variables classes functions and more es6
0:25
modules were introduced as part of the
0:27
ecmascript 2015 update using modules we
0:30
can create some reusable code that can
0:32
be used in different programs different
0:34
JavaScript files so what we'll do in
0:37
this example we will create a new
0:40
file I'll create a module for some math
0:43
utility functions this file will be math
0:47
u. JS it's a separate Javascript
0:51
file from our index file we will import
0:55
this module math
0:57
u.j but in order to do so within our
1:00
HTML file we have to set the type
1:04
attribute equal to
1:07
module we'll now treat our index file as
1:09
a module we can Import and Export other
1:12
modules freely but we have to be sure to
1:14
include this attribute and set it equal
1:16
to
1:18
module So within our math util module we
1:21
can write some reusable code for other
1:24
programs so let's define what Pi is Pi =
1:28
3.14
1:31
4159 we'll create a function to get
1:34
circumference you have to pass in a
1:36
radius though that's going to be the
1:38
parameter function get
1:43
circumference we need a
1:46
radius we will
1:49
return 2 * pi *
1:55
radius then we'll create a function to
1:57
get
1:58
area
2:00
get area we still need a
2:04
radius we will return Pi * radius time
2:11
radius then get volume to get the volume
2:14
of a
2:15
sphere function get
2:18
volume again we need a
2:21
radius we will
2:23
return 4 * PK * radius * radius
2:31
I can reuse these variables and
2:32
functions for any JavaScript program
2:34
that I have I can import them in order
2:37
to do so though we need to be sure that
2:38
we prefix each variable function or
2:41
class or anything else with the export
2:44
keyword so that we can import it
2:46
elsewhere so let's be sure we do
2:51
that all right be sure to save
2:53
everything we can close out of this
2:55
module then from our index CSS file I
2:59
will import then we're going to use
3:02
object destructuring we need a set of
3:03
curly
3:05
braces from the location of that module
3:09
so these files are right next to each
3:11
other relatively speaking they're right
3:13
next to each other I would need slash
3:17
the name of that file math util and this
3:21
is a Javascript
3:23
file now anything I would like to import
3:26
I'll place within the set of curly
3:27
braces we're going to be using object
3:29
structuring from this JavaScript module
3:32
I would like Pi comma separate each
3:36
entity then I would like get
3:41
circumference get area get
3:46
volume I can now use these variables and
3:49
functions as if they were already part
3:51
of my Javascript file for example I'm
3:54
going to
3:56
console.log Pi and pi does have a value
4:00
because we imported it let's get the
4:03
circumference but we do need to pass in
4:05
a radius this is a function that we have
4:08
imported from that mathutils module I
4:11
will store the result within a
4:17
variable const circumference equals
4:21
we'll invoke the get circumference
4:23
function from that module I'll pass in
4:25
10 then we're going to display the
4:27
circumference I'll use console
4:30
log I'll use a template string include a
4:33
placeholder display their circumference
4:36
plus a unit of measurement like
4:38
centimet 62. 8318 CM this isn't
4:43
necessary but I'm going to round this
4:44
number to two decimal places using the
4:47
two fixed method of numbers let's round
4:50
to two decimal places let's create an
4:53
area variable const area equals get area
4:59
I'll pass in 10 for the
5:01
radius let's copy this line and paste it
5:04
because I'm lazy let's display our area
5:07
variable with cm
5:10
cubed
5:12
31416 cm cubed then we'll create a
5:16
volume variable const volume equals get
5:21
volume I will pass in
5:24
10 and then we will display the
5:28
volume
5:30
volume cm cubed and our volume if we
5:34
pass in a radius of 10 would be
5:37
1,256 64 cm cubed all right everybody so
5:41
those are modules they're external files
5:44
that contain reusable code that can be
5:47
imported into other JavaScript files you
5:49
can write variables classes functions
5:51
and more that can be reused in other
5:53
programs you just have to be sure to
5:55
import them and well everybody those are
5:58
es6 modules in
6:03
JavaScript
