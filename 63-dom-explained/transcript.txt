all right what's going on people so
0:01
today I got to explain what the Dom is
0:03
in JavaScript the Dom is the document
0:06
object model it's a JavaScript object
0:09
that represents the page you see in the
0:11
web browser and it provides you with an
0:13
API to interact with it the web browser
0:16
constructs the Dom when it loads an HTML
0:18
document and structures all of the
0:20
elements in a tree likee representation
0:22
within my HTML document we have our HTML
0:25
element as the root element the HTML
0:28
element contains a head element and a
0:30
body element and many various elements
0:32
can be found within each of these
0:34
they're arranged in a tree like data
0:36
structure but we access this tree like
0:38
data structure from the document object
0:41
in past lessons in order to select an
0:43
element by its ID we would type document
0:46
dot then follow it with a method like
0:49
get element by ID and then we would
0:52
select an element by its ID our document
0:55
is an object it contains properties and
0:57
methods and other nested objects if I
1:00
was to
1:02
console.log the
1:05
document well then it's going to display
1:08
my HTML
1:10
document now you can also use dur
1:12
meaning directory this will list all of
1:15
the properties of this
1:18
object so here's my document object and
1:21
all of the different properties it
1:23
contains it's one gigantic object for
1:26
example we have a title the title of the
1:29
web page
1:31
that would be found right here near the
1:32
bottom document but you can change
1:36
it I will access our document as if it
1:39
was an object because it is access the
1:42
title property change it to something
1:44
else like my
1:46
website now if I display the
1:50
title that property has changed it's now
1:52
my website dynamically after the page
1:55
loads I would like to change the
1:57
background color of my document later on
1:59
in the series we're going to create a
2:00
toggle button to toggle between light
2:02
and dark mode just to give you an
2:04
example if I need to change my theme to
2:06
be dark mode I could access the document
2:10
object access the
2:12
body access the style then change the
2:16
background color property to some color
2:21
let's stick with black for
2:23
now I'll use
2:25
hsl the Hue will be zero saturation will
2:28
be 0%
2:30
and the lightness will be
2:33
15% even though we have no CSS we're
2:36
still able to dynamically change the
2:38
background color let me give you another
2:42
example we'll create an H1
2:45
element this H1 element will say
2:49
welcome I will give this element an ID
2:53
ID
2:54
welcome- MSG meaning
2:58
message
3:01
and I'm just going to zoom in a little I
3:03
will create a constant of
3:06
username type in your username or your
3:08
full
3:10
name I'm going to conditionally change
3:13
the content of this HTML document I will
3:17
get this element by its ID our welcome
3:20
message const welcome message I'm using
3:25
camel case naming convention for this so
3:27
I will access my document use the get
3:31
element by ID method that ID was welcom
3:36
Das message MSG for short I would like
3:40
to update the text content of this
3:42
element I'll take my welcome
3:45
message access the text content of it
3:49
then append some text using string
3:52
catenation I'll use the tary operator to
3:54
see if my username is strictly equal to
3:58
an empty string is our username empty
4:01
did somebody not type it
4:03
in question mark If username is empty I
4:07
will append our welcome message with
4:10
guest otherwise our
4:13
username my username has a name it's not
4:16
empty it will display my name welcome
4:19
bro code if it was empty if somebody
4:21
didn't type it in it will display
4:23
welcome guest so that's an introduction
4:26
to the document object model the
4:28
document object model is a JavaScript
4:31
object that represents the page you see
4:33
in the web browser and it provides you
4:35
with an API to interact with it the web
4:37
browser constructs the Dom when it loads
4:39
an HTML document and structures all of
4:42
the elements in a tree like
4:43
representation by using JavaScript we
4:45
can access the Dom dynamically after the
4:48
page loads and change the content
4:50
structure and style of a web page and
4:53
well everybody that is an introduction
4:55
to the document object model in
4:58
JavaScript
