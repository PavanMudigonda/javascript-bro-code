0:00
so uh yeah it's me again so today I'm
0:03
gonna explain the strict equality
0:05
operator which is represented by three
0:07
equal signs before we dive in let me
0:10
make a few important distinctions a
0:12
single equal sign is the assignment
0:14
operator you usually see it when you
0:15
assign a value to a variable the
0:18
comparison operator two equal signs is
0:20
used to compare two values to see if
0:22
they're equal now the strict equality
0:24
operator has a whopping three equal
0:26
signs it not only Compares if two values
0:29
are equal but if they have the same data
0:31
type as well let me give you a
0:33
demonstration suppose we have a constant
0:36
named pipe
0:37
pi equals 3.14 pi in my example has a
0:42
data type of number
0:44
I'll create an if statement
0:46
we will check if pi
0:49
is equal to the string at 3.14
0:54
if it is let's console DOT log
1:00
that is pi
1:02
else
1:04
we will console.log
1:07
that is not pi
1:09
is the number 3.14 equal to the string
1:12
3.14
1:14
well according to JavaScript that is pi
1:16
that's because we're using the
1:18
comparison operator we don't care about
1:20
the data type we only care about the
1:22
value are the values equal
1:24
now if I was using the strict equality
1:27
operator which is three equal signs
1:30
well then JavaScript tells me that this
1:32
is not pi
1:34
because with the strict equality
1:36
operator not only do we compare the
1:38
values but we also compare the data
1:41
types as well these values are both 3.14
1:44
but this one is a number data type and
1:47
we're comparing it to a string so they
1:49
don't match technically
1:51
if we were strictly comparing the number
1:53
3.14 to the number 3.14 well then we
1:57
have a match that is pi
2:00
one case where this is pretty helpful is
2:02
when you accept user input because user
2:04
input tends to be a string data type and
2:07
then just as an extra measure you can
2:09
use the strict equality operator and
2:11
then be sure that the value is a number
2:13
data type
2:14
there's also the inequality operator it
2:17
will return true if two values are not
2:20
equal
2:21
so let's take
2:23
shut up this time we will examine if Pi
2:26
does not equal the string 3.14
2:32
if these are not equal this condition
2:35
will evaluate to be true
2:37
so this is not Pi else this is pi is the
2:42
number 3.14 not equal to the string 3.14
2:47
well that is Pi still
2:50
using the inequality operator these
2:53
values are still the same the inequality
2:55
operator will return false then there's
2:58
the strict inequality operator
3:01
an exclamation point and two equal signs
3:04
are the values or the data type
3:06
different
3:07
so in this example
3:09
that is not pi
3:12
they have the same values but the data
3:14
type is different
3:15
if I turned my variable Pi into a string
3:20
well that is pi now
3:22
the string 3.14 stored within pi
3:26
does equal the string 3.14 so this
3:29
condition turns out to be false so we
3:31
execute the else statement it might take
3:33
you a little bit of time to get used to
3:35
this and that's okay it is a little odd
3:38
but just in case you see these in the
3:40
future you'll at least be familiar with
3:42
them from now on we will try and use the
3:44
strict equality operator if we can and
3:47
well everybody that is the strict
3:48
equality operator and I guess well the
3:51
inequality operator and strict
3:52
inequality operator in JavaScript
