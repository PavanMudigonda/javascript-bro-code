yo so uh what's up today I'm going to be
0:02
talking about the sort method in
0:04
JavaScript the sort method is used to
0:06
sort elements of an array in place
0:09
however with the sort method we sort
0:11
elements as strings in lexicographic
0:14
order not alphabetical if I could
0:16
summarize what lexicographic means it
0:19
means alphabet Plus numbers plus symbols
0:21
as strings let me give you an example
0:23
with just alphabetical characters I have
0:26
an array of fruits to sort this array I
0:28
can take the array name fruits use the
0:31
built-in sort method then
0:35
console.log my array of fruits let me
0:39
expand this and here's my array all
0:42
sorted when sorting we treat any
0:45
elements as strings what if my array
0:47
were numbers I'll add the numbers 1
0:49
through 10 in a somewhat random
0:57
order let's change our array to be
1:00
numbers numbers. sort console.log
1:03
numbers here's the result we have one
1:08
then 10 then the rest seem to be in
1:10
order we're not sorting this array
1:12
numerically we're sorting this array
1:15
lexor graphically we're treating each of
1:17
these numbers as strings that's why we
1:19
have one then 10 10 isn't at the end
1:22
where we expect it would be there's a
1:24
couple extra steps we need to do
1:25
involving sorting
1:27
numbers inside of the sort method we
1:29
have to write a custom comparison
1:31
function this is normally a callback but
1:34
you can write a function expression or
1:35
even better yet an arrow function we'll
1:38
write an arrow function in this case let
1:40
me zoom in with an arrow function we
1:43
first need
1:44
parameters we'll have parameters A and B
1:48
we'll examine two contiguous elements 1
1:51
then 10 10 then 2 two then nine N9 and
1:55
three so on and so forth then we need an
1:58
arrow
2:00
then we'll write a minus B our function
2:04
a minus B will return either a0 or
2:08
positive value depending on what values
2:10
we're examining the sort method will
2:12
sort those values into place depending
2:14
on what the value returned is our array
2:17
should be sorted you can see that 10 is
2:20
at the end instead of right after one
2:23
for reverse order you could say B minus
2:28
a now we're starting with 10 and ending
2:31
with
2:32
one you can even sort objects by a given
2:36
property let's go over that
2:38
example we will create an array of
2:40
people const people equals this will be
2:45
an array will include four objects all
2:48
comma
2:50
separated the first will have a name
2:53
property of
2:58
SpongeBob age
3:00
30 and a GPA
3:04
GPA
3:06
3.0 I'm going to zoom out for the next
3:10
object just going to put that on a new
3:12
line let's copy all these properties
3:15
change name to be Patrick age will be
3:19
37 GPA
3:23
1.5 again for the next
3:26
object we will have
3:28
Squidward
3:30
age
3:32
51 GPA
3:36
2.5 then lastly we'll have Sandy name
3:41
Sandy let's make Sandy
3:45
27 GPA of course it's going to be a
3:49
4.0 I would like to sort this array of
3:51
objects by each person's age we'll take
3:54
our array of objects that's stored
3:56
within
3:58
people use the built-in sort
4:02
method use our Arrow
4:04
function a comma B
4:08
Arrow we'll take parameter a that's
4:11
person one do access their age property
4:15
minus parameter B access their age
4:19
property and that's all you got to do
4:22
now let's
4:24
console.log R
4:28
people
4:33
there we are we have Sandy who's the
4:35
youngest then SpongeBob Patrick
4:38
Squidward for reverse order you'll just
4:41
change a to be B and B to be
4:47
a Squidward Patrick SpongeBob Sandy or
4:51
we can sort by a different property
4:52
let's do GPA this
4:55
time a. GPA b. GPA
5:03
we have Patrick with the lowest GPA
5:05
followed by Squidward SpongeBob Sandy
5:08
then reverse order would be b. GPA minus
5:12
a.
5:13
GPA Sandy SpongeBob Squidward Patrick
5:17
let's try sorting by the name property
5:19
and see what happens
5:22
a.name minus b.n
5:27
name we have SpongeBob Patrick's
5:29
Squidward Sandy but that doesn't seem to
5:31
make sense these aren't in alphabetical
5:33
order if you need to sort by a property
5:36
that contains a string within an object
5:38
there's a different
5:40
formula we will take
5:43
a.name do use the built-in
5:47
local compare
5:49
method compare to b.
5:53
name this method will examine two
5:55
strings for lexicographic
5:58
order now these are all arranged
6:02
lexicographically starting with Patrick
6:04
then Sandy SpongeBob Squidward for
6:07
reverse lexicographic order we would
6:09
take b.n name. local compare then
6:12
examine
6:14
a.name I've just now realized that
6:16
there's a lot of SpongeBob characters
6:18
whose first name starts with an S like
6:20
we have three right here Squidward
6:22
SpongeBob Sandy Patrick all right
6:24
everybody so that is the sort method
6:26
it's used to sort elements of an array
6:28
in place it sorts elements as strings in
6:31
lexicographic order not alphabetical and
6:34
well everybody that is the sort method
6:36
in
6:40
