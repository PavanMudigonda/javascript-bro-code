intro
0:00
yeah what's going on people so uh today
0:03
I'm going to show you how we can accept
0:04
some user input in JavaScript generally
0:07
there's two good ways of doing this the
0:09
easy way is to create a window prompt
0:11
the professional way is to create an
0:14
html text box of some sort and you'll
0:17
likely need a button to submit the user
window prompt
0:19
input let's begin with the easy way
0:20
we'll create a window prompt the first
0:23
thing we should do is declare all of the
0:25
variables we're going to use let's
0:27
create a variable named username we'll
0:30
declare it but not yet assign it then
0:32
when we assign it we can set username
0:35
equal to then to create a window prompt
0:38
we can type window dot prompt
0:42
parentheses
0:44
then within the parentheses our window
0:46
prompt can contain some text
0:48
let's ask what's your username
0:53
okay let's run this and see what happens
0:56
what's your username I will type in my
0:58
username press ok
1:01
we have this variable username it will
1:04
have a value but we should do something
1:05
with it
1:06
let's console DOT log
1:11
our username
1:13
let's try that again
1:16
what's your username I'll type in my
1:18
username feel free to type in yours
1:21
let's check our Dev tools
1:25
and here is my username
1:27
so that's the easy way to accept user
1:29
input with this window prompt you could
1:31
assign declaration and assignment
1:33
together if you want to
1:35
you know that would also work now we
HTML textbox
1:37
will accept user input the professional
1:39
Way by creating an html text box
1:43
we will navigate to our HTML file
1:46
okay let's create an H1 element that
1:49
says welcome
1:52
we'll need a text box
1:54
we'll use a self-closing input tag
1:58
I will set the ID of this text box to be
2:01
my text
2:04
I'll create a label for this text box
2:06
too because if we're a user we don't
2:08
know what we're supposed to type in here
2:11
I will create a label
2:15
the text within the label will be
2:17
username
2:20
then a submit button
2:24
button
2:26
the text will be submit
2:28
I'll put this on a new line I'll add a
2:30
Break Tag
2:32
maybe two
2:34
make it look nice
2:35
for the ID of the button
2:37
I'll set the ID to be my submit
2:42
let's see if this works
2:44
this is a little Advanced when we click
2:47
on this button we're going to execute a
2:49
function but we need to select this
2:51
button
2:52
we will access the document of our web
2:55
page
2:56
get element by ID
3:00
the ID that we're getting is the ID of
3:03
the button my submit
3:05
So within quotes type the name of the ID
3:09
follow this with DOT on click
3:13
equals
3:15
here we'll write everything we're going
3:17
to do after clicking the button
3:19
we need a function
3:21
function parentheses curly braces
3:24
everything between this set of curly
3:26
braces is everything we'll do when we
3:29
click on the button
3:31
so first we need a username variable
3:34
outside of the function
3:36
when we click on the button
3:38
get the text from this text box
3:41
we will reassign our username then set
3:43
the SQL to the text from the text box
3:47
we'll use document.getelementbyid
3:50
[Music]
3:52
the ID that we're getting this time is
3:54
my text
3:59
we need the value of the text box so
4:02
follow this with DOT value
4:05
all right then to test this let's
4:08
console DOT log
4:10
the username
4:14
all right let's type in our username
4:16
press submit
4:18
then check devtools
4:21
yeah there it is
4:23
okay let's replace console.log
4:26
we'll change the text content of our H1
4:28
element
4:30
I will give this H1 element a unique ID
4:33
let's say my H1
4:37
we need to select my H1 element
4:41
document.getelementbyid the ID was my H1
4:46
we are changing the text
4:49
content equal to
4:52
let's use a template literal hello
4:56
username
4:58
all right let's try this again type in
5:00
your username
5:01
press submit and that should change the
5:04
H1 element hello whatever your name is
5:08
all right everybody so those are two
5:10
different ways to accept user input you
5:12
can use a window prompt or you can use
5:14
an html text box and that is how to
5:17
accept user input in JavaScript
