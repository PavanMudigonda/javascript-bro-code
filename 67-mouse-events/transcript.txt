hey everybody in today's video I got to
0:01
explain Mouse events in JavaScript so
0:04
sit back relax and enjoy the show the
0:07
first thing I need to discuss is event
0:08
listeners an event listener listens for
0:11
specific events to create interactive
0:14
web pages a few types of events we'll
0:16
discuss are click events when we click
0:18
on something Mouse over is when we hover
0:20
over something and mouse out is when
0:22
we're hovering over something and then
0:24
leave that element to add an event
0:25
listener you'll use the add event
0:27
listener method pass in an event type
0:30
including but not limited to this could
0:32
be clicking on something hovering over
0:35
something or leaving the confines of an
0:36
element and then a call back to a
0:38
function what do you want to do when you
0:40
interact with something for example I
0:43
could use the click event and then
0:45
change the color of something when I
0:47
click on it going to our HTML file I
0:49
will create a development for a box the
0:53
ID of this development will be my box
0:56
the text on the box will be click me
1:00
then for fun I'll add an emoji because I
1:03
like emojis let's apply some CSS styling
1:06
cuz it's kind of small let's select the
1:08
ID of my box change the background
1:12
color to light green or some other color
1:15
of you're choosing set a width of 300
1:20
pixels a height of 300
1:23
pixels I'll increase the font size to
1:27
something large like 4 5
1:30
RM I'll set the font weight to be
1:35
bold I'll use flexbox display
1:39
Flex align items in the
1:43
center and text align
1:48
center that is good enough for now be
1:50
sure to save everything we're going to
1:52
select the ID of my box we'll store that
1:55
as a constant const my box equals we'll
1:59
need to select it by accessing the Dom
2:02
document. getet element by ID I will
2:06
select the ID of my box and then we can
2:10
work with it easily we'll take my box
2:14
add an event listener that's a built-in
2:16
method my box. add event
2:21
listener we need to pass in an event
2:23
type and a call back to a function I
2:26
want to do something when I click on
2:28
this box the event type is going to be
2:31
click and now we need to call back to a
2:34
function we'll Define a function to
2:36
change the background
2:37
color function change color there's
2:42
going to be one parameter an event then
2:45
we will pass in a call back to change
2:47
color now the event parameter event is
2:50
an object it's provided to us
2:52
automatically by the web browser when
2:55
something happens when an event occurs
2:57
like when I click on something event is
2:59
an object that contains information
3:01
about something that happens that event
3:04
for this demonstration temporarily I'm
3:06
going to console.log my event so let's
3:10
click on the box then go to
3:13
inspect console and here's my event when
3:17
we clicked on that box the web browser
3:19
provided us with an event object it's a
3:22
pointer event this object contains
3:25
details about what happened
3:28
exactly for example we have the target
3:31
what did we click on WE clicked on the
3:33
div element with an ID of my box and
3:35
here are all the properties and methods
3:36
of that box that's the target we have a
3:39
Tim stamp of when the click occurred the
3:42
type of the event click which matches up
3:45
with the event type and coordinates of
3:47
where we clicked on the
3:49
screen event is an object that's going
3:51
to be provided to us through the web
3:53
browser automatically we don't need to
3:55
explicitly pass in an event object with
3:58
this call back it's provided to us
4:00
behind the
4:00
scenes I'm going to change the
4:02
background color of our box when we
4:04
click on it we will access our event
4:07
object that's provided to us access the
4:09
target the target is what we clicked on
4:12
there's information about our Target
4:14
within the event object then I will take
4:17
the style of the target set the
4:19
background color property to be a
4:21
different color I will set it to be red
4:24
but I prefer the shade of tomato because
4:26
I like that color now when I click on
4:29
the butt
4:30
the background color
4:32
changes but why stop there let's also
4:34
change the text content I'll add one
4:37
more statement to the change color
4:38
function again we will access our event
4:42
access its Target access the text
4:45
content of the target to be
4:49
ouch and then I'll add an
4:53
emoji that's a good
4:56
one when I click on this box not only
4:59
does the color change but the text too
5:03
now you don't necessarily need to pass
5:04
in a call back you can also pass in an
5:07
anonymous function or even an arrow
5:09
function so let's copy these two lines
5:11
of code we'll reuse it later we no
5:14
longer need to define a
5:16
function within the event listener
5:18
instead of passing in a call back we'll
5:20
pass in an anonymous
5:23
function we have one parameter an event
5:27
that's going to be provided to us when
5:29
we click on my box do this change the
5:32
background color and the
5:34
text now we could even use an arrow
5:37
function I have a preference for Arrow
5:38
functions because they're concise with
5:40
their syntax with an arrow function we
5:42
have one parameter an event if you have
5:45
a single parameter you don't need to
5:47
enclose it within a set of
5:49
parentheses we have one parameter of
5:51
event then do this do all this code and
5:55
that should still work when I click on
5:57
the box the color changes as well as the
6:00
text so when you add an event listener
6:03
you can pass in a call back or an
6:05
anonymous
6:07
function or an arrow function it depends
6:11
on what your preferences are personally
6:13
I like Arrow functions we have a few
6:15
other Mouse events to discuss Mouse over
6:18
and mouse out Mouse over is when you
6:20
hover your cursor over something so
6:23
let's take my
6:24
box add a new event listener an element
6:27
can have more than one event listener
6:30
add event
6:32
listener we have an event and a call
6:35
back as arguments the event is going to
6:38
be Mouse over for the call back I'll use
6:43
an arrow
6:45
function we have one parameter of event
6:48
Arrow do this let's copy these two lines
6:52
of code I'll change the background color
6:55
to be yellow like it's a warning and the
6:58
text cont content to be don't do
7:03
it that's a good face when I hover my
7:07
cursor over this element the background
7:09
color and the text is going to
7:10
change the event that occurred is mouse
7:13
over it's when you hover your cursor
7:15
over something Mouse out is when you
7:17
leave a specified element so when I
7:19
leave the box I would like to change
7:22
back the background color and the text
7:24
content We'll add an additional event
7:26
listener my box add
7:30
event
7:32
listener the event type is going to be
7:35
Mouse out then I'll write an arrow
7:38
function we're provided with an event
7:41
Arrow do this let's change the
7:44
background color and the text content I
7:46
will revert the background color to be
7:48
light
7:49
green and the text to be click
7:53
me whatever the text content originally
7:56
was when I hovered my cursor over this
7:58
element
8:00
we get that Mouse over event but when I
8:02
leave we get the mouse out
8:04
event when I click on this box we get
8:08
the click event when I leave the Box we
8:11
get the mouse out event again to reset
8:13
it essentially for the last part of this
8:15
demonstration we're going to create a
8:16
button when we click or interact with
8:19
the button then we'll change a separate
8:21
element this box so within our HTML file
8:24
let's create a
8:26
button with text of click
8:30
me I will give this button a unique ID
8:33
of my
8:35
button and I'll increase the font size
8:37
with CSS we will select my
8:40
button I will increase the font size to
8:44
be three
8:46
RM just so it's not so
8:49
small let's select the ID of my
8:53
button const my button equals document.
8:57
getet element by idid
8:59
my button I'll add the event listener to
9:03
my button not my
9:06
box if I was to interact with this
9:08
button with the way it is now when I
9:10
hover over the button we've created a
9:13
mouseover event and the button changes
9:15
when I click on the button we're
9:17
changing the HTML and CSS of the button
9:20
because the button is what has the event
9:22
listener we're selecting the target of
9:24
the event to change which is the button
9:26
that is what we interacted with when we
9:28
interact with our box it doesn't do
9:29
anything it doesn't have any event
9:31
listeners the button does though we're
9:33
going to replace the event Target with
9:35
my box when we interact with the button
9:39
change the background color and the text
9:41
content of my
9:45
box so then when I hover over the button
9:48
the Box changes when I leave it reverts
9:51
back to normal when I click on the
9:53
button then we've created a click event
9:56
all right everybody so that is an
9:57
introduction to Mouse related events
9:59
you'll need to add an event listener an
10:01
event listener listens for specific
10:03
events to create interactive web pages a
10:06
few events we've covered include click
10:08
Mouse over and mouse out to add an event
10:11
listener take an element use the
10:13
built-in ad event listener method pass
10:16
in an event type and a call back
10:18
Anonymous function or an arrow function
10:20
to do something and well everybody those
10:22
are Mouse related events in
10:28
JavaScript
