introduction

hey it's me again today I'm going to
0:01
explain the for each method in
0:03
JavaScript the for each method is used
0:05
to iterate meaning Loop through the
0:07
elements of an array and apply a
0:09
specified function to each element you
0:11
have an array we can use the built-in
0:13
for each method of arrays and send each
0:16
element through a call back to a
example 1
0:18
function here's an example I'll create
0:20
an array of numbers let numbers equals 1
0:24
through
0:28
5 then I'm going to create a function to
0:31
display each
0:32
element function
0:35
display there will be one
0:38
parameter an element we will
0:41
individually display each element within
0:43
this array
0:46
console.log each
0:49
element I can display each element of
0:52
this array by using the for each
0:54
method we will take our
0:58
array Dot use the built-in for each
1:01
method then pass a call back as an
1:04
argument we will pass our display
1:06
function as an argument so this should
1:09
display all of the elements in my array
1:11
to the console 1 2 3 4 5 believe it or
1:14
not the element argument is provided for
1:17
us with the for each method behind the
1:19
scenes the for each method will provide
1:21
to a callback an element index and array
1:24
argument an element for the current
1:26
element that we're on when looping
1:28
through this array an index that keeps
1:31
track of the current index number and
1:33
the location of the array itself in this
1:35
case it would be numbers that's why when
1:37
we pass the display function as a
1:38
callback we're already provided with an
1:40
element argument behind the scenes so
1:42
we're using the for each method to
1:44
display all of the elements of this
1:46
array let's use the for each method
1:48
again to double each element before
1:50
displaying it I will create a new
1:52
function function double to double the
1:56
value of each
1:57
element element index and array are
2:00
provided for us
2:02
automatically for each element what are
2:04
we going to do let's take our array at
2:08
index of index index keeps track of the
2:12
current index number so during each
2:14
iteration it's going to increment by one
2:17
starting with zero we will take our
2:20
element multiply it by
2:23
two all right so let's take our numbers
2:26
array use the for each method then pass
2:30
a call back to our double
2:32
function so now all of these elements
2:34
should be doubled let's triple them now
2:37
we'll create a function for triple
2:40
function triple we will set the
2:42
parameters to be the same but we will
2:45
multiply each element by three then pass
2:48
in a call back for
2:50
triple so now we have 3 6 9 12 15
2:54
they're all tripled let's Square each
2:56
element function Square
3:00
again the element index and array
3:02
arguments are provided for us take our
3:05
array that we receive at index of the
3:09
current index number set the equal to to
3:12
square a number we can use the power
3:14
method of math then raise a base to a
3:18
given power we are raising our base of
3:21
element to the power of two if I pass
3:24
our Square function as a call back to
3:26
for each we will now Square each number
3:29
before playing it 1
3:32
49625 then this time let's create a cube
3:37
function function
3:40
Cube raise our element to the power of
3:43
three pass our Cube function as a call
3:46
back to the for each
3:48
method and now each number is cubed 1 8
3:52
27
3:53
6415 let's create a more practical
3:57
example I will create an array of fruits
example 2
4:02
let fruits equals some fruit we have an
4:05
apple we have an
4:07
orange a
4:09
banana and a coconut we'll create a
4:13
function to display each
4:15
element function display it's kind of
4:18
like what we did
4:21
before an element argument is going to
4:23
be provided to us during each
4:26
iteration let's console.log each
4:31
element and then we will use the buil-in
4:34
for each method of our array fruits
4:37
fruits. for each we will pass our
4:40
function as a callback to display each
4:43
element of this array Apple orange
4:45
banana coconut let's create a function
4:47
to make all of these strings
4:51
uppercase
4:53
function
4:56
uppercase we'll need an element index
4:58
and array
5:00
element index array during each
5:03
iteration let's take our array that we
5:07
receive add the index of our index
5:11
equals take the element that we receive
5:15
use the two uppercase method so we have
5:20
an uppercase function that utilizes the
5:23
two uppercase method remember that a
5:25
method usually belongs to something this
5:28
method belongs to the element that we
5:30
receive functions are Standalone before
5:33
displaying each element within my array
5:35
of fruits let's take our fruits array
5:38
use the for each method then apply a
5:41
call back to uppercase to make all of
5:43
the elements uppercase before displaying
5:45
them what I'm going to do is copy all of
5:48
these elements so they will begin
5:54
uppercase I'll create a lowercase
5:57
function function
6:00
lowercase we have our element index and
6:02
array with this line of code we will use
6:05
the two lowercase method within the for
6:09
each method we will pass our lowercase
6:12
function as a callback to make all of
6:14
the elements
6:16
lowercase let's set the elements of our
6:18
array to be all lowercase
6:20
again this will be a challenge
6:23
round we will capitalize the first
6:25
letter in each element of this
6:28
array we will create a
6:32
function
6:37
capitalize the element index and array
6:39
arguments are going to be provided to us
6:42
take our array that we receive at the
6:45
current index set this equal to we're
6:48
going to get the first character in each
6:50
element we will take our
6:53
element get the first character Char at
6:58
index of zero
7:00
method chain
7:01
2
7:03
uppercase to make this letter
7:06
uppercase then we will string
7:08
concatenate our
7:10
element use the slice
7:13
method we'll create a substring begin at
7:16
index one this portion is going to
7:19
create a substring of every character
7:22
besides the first the first character
7:24
we're going to make
7:26
uppercase so now this should work so
7:28
let's take our capital I function pass
7:31
it to the for each method and now the
7:33
first character in each element is all
7:36
uppercase all right everybody so that is
conclusion
7:38
the for each method it's used to iterate
7:41
over the elements of an array and apply
7:43
a specified function as a call back to
7:46
each element you take your array use the
7:48
for each method then pass a call back as
7:50
an argument it's really useful if you
7:52
need to apply a function to each element
7:54
of this array and well everybody that is
7:56
the for each method in JavaScript
