HTML
0:00
hey what's going on people so in today's
0:01
video we're going to create a digital
0:03
clock using JavaScript HTML and CSS so
0:07
let's get started the HTML for this
0:10
project is going to be very minimal I
0:12
will create a development the ID of the
0:15
develop will be clock Das container
0:19
within this development we'll have a
0:21
nested development with an ID of clock
0:25
we have a clock within a clock container
0:28
as a placeholder temporar ly the text on
0:31
the clock will be 0 0 colon 0 0 colon 0
0:36
0
0:38
00000000 and I'm just going to zoom in
0:41
temporarily and that is all the HTML
0:43
that we need let's head to our CSS
CSS
0:47
stylesheet let's begin with the
0:50
body I will set all margin to be zero
0:54
originally let's select our clock
0:57
container ID clock
1:01
container I'll use flex box for the
1:03
clock
1:04
container display
1:07
Flex I will justify content in the
1:11
center justify content
1:16
Center if you would also like to
1:18
vertically align you'll need to add the
1:20
following two lines of code I will
1:23
align items
1:26
Center this CSS property will vertically
1:29
align elements but the clock container
1:31
itself is kind of small for example I'll
1:34
add a border of two pixel
1:38
solid the elements within the clock
1:40
container are aligned both horizontally
1:42
and vertically but the container itself
1:44
is kind of small to vertically align
1:46
this element within the window itself
1:48
we'll have to increase the height of the
1:49
clock container I will add height of 100
1:55
VH for the viewport height and we can
1:58
remove the Border
2:00
yep the clock is now within the middle
2:02
of the container both horizontally and
2:04
vertically but if you prefer to be at
2:06
the top you can eliminate these last two
2:08
lines it's up to you let's style the
2:11
clock itself we are selecting the ID of
2:16
clock I will change the font family to
2:20
be
2:23
monospace this is the normal size when
2:25
I'm zoomed in to 100% I will set the
2:29
font size to be
2:31
6.5
2:33
R then set the font weight to be
2:39
bold and text align
2:43
Center if you would like a background
2:45
image for the body of your document I
2:48
just so happen to have one right here
2:50
it's a picture of Central Park in New
2:51
York this is optional but if you would
2:53
like to include a background image of
2:55
this project within your CSS stylesheet
2:58
you'll add the following CSS
3:01
properties I will set the background
3:04
image property to be a
3:07
URL so what is the name of that image
3:11
I'm going to copy the name of it and
3:14
paste it within this URL
3:16
function I'll set the background
3:18
position to be the center right now
3:20
we're seeing the top left of the image
3:23
instead of the
3:24
center
3:26
background Position will be
3:32
Center if you're using a small image
3:35
your image might be repeating itself to
3:37
take up all the available space to
3:39
prevent that you can set the
3:41
background repeat
3:45
property to be no
3:49
repeat mine already wasn't repeating
3:52
though but yours might be then we'll set
3:55
the
3:57
background size to
4:00
cover by adding this property this image
4:04
will cover the entire window and
4:06
maintain its aspect ratio if you do have
4:09
additional content besides this clock
4:11
you can keep the background in place
4:13
when you scroll down by adding this
4:16
property
4:17
background
4:20
attachment to be
4:23
fixed this property isn't going to be
4:26
apparent because we don't have a scroll
4:27
bar but if you did have a scroll bar the
4:30
background will stay in place at least
4:32
let's head back to our clock element I
4:34
will change the color the font color to
4:37
be
4:38
white if you would like a background
4:40
blur effect you'll add this property
4:43
we'll set the backdrop filter property
4:47
to be a blur
4:49
function the greater the number the more
4:52
blur effect you're going to
4:53
have so this is 5 pixels if I were to
4:57
increase this to 50 well well there's a
4:59
lot of blur then I'll set my blur to be
5:02
five I would just like a little bit as
5:04
if we're looking through glass I'll
5:06
increase the width to be 100% to take up
5:09
100% of the width of the web
5:11
browser width
5:15
100% to give this glass look a foggy
5:18
appearance we can add a background color
5:20
that's slightly
5:22
gray background-
5:26
color let's select gray but I like using
5:29
us hsl values so for the lightness I'll
5:32
set it to be
5:34
100% but I'm going to lower the alpha
5:37
down to like
5:41
10% now the background has a foggy glass
5:44
appearance if you were to increase the
5:46
amount of
5:47
alpha that'll increase the
5:50
lightness I'll keep mine as 10% 0.1 for
5:53
the
5:54
alpha all right now we just need to get
5:57
this clock to run so let's save
5:59
everything go to our Javascript
6:02
file we will create a function to update
JavaScript
6:06
our
6:09
clock immediately when we begin this
6:11
program we will update our clock once
6:14
immediately now we need to get the
6:16
current time let's declare a constant of
6:20
now what is the time right now this will
6:23
be a new date
6:25
object to get the hour we will say const
6:29
hours equals use the
6:33
builtin get hours method then let's do
6:37
this with minutes const minutes equals
6:41
now. getet minutes
6:44
method and seconds const seconds equals
6:50
now. get
6:53
seconds I'm going to change the text
6:56
content of the clock to be a time string
6:59
it will be a template string how do we
7:01
want to arrange our
7:03
numbers const time string equals a
7:08
template
7:10
string first we'll add a placeholder for
7:13
our hours
7:15
colon
7:17
minutes
7:19
colon
7:21
seconds then we will select the ID of
7:25
clock document. getet element by ID the
7:30
ID that we're getting is our
7:33
clock change the text content to equal
7:38
our time string when we save the time on
7:42
the clock should update currently for me
7:44
it's 8:00 for each of these placeholders
7:47
for hours minutes and seconds I would
7:50
like each to take up two digits We'll
7:53
add some zeros for padding for example
7:55
this time will be 08
7:58
006
7:59
there's a built-in string method for
8:01
that so with hours minutes and seconds
8:04
we will convert these to
8:06
Strings we'll use method chaining then
8:08
add to string do this for hours minutes
8:12
and
8:13
seconds with strings there's a pad start
8:19
method for the first two
8:21
characters pad them with a
8:24
zero let's copy this method and paste it
8:27
for minutes and seconds now when I save
8:30
and update the time we have zero padding
8:33
08 01 54 in this case to get this clock
8:37
to update every second we'll follow
8:40
update clock with the set interval
8:44
function set interval works like set
8:47
timeout except it will call a function
8:49
repeatedly not just once but we need a
8:52
call back the Callback will be update
8:54
clock call this function after every
8:57
1,000 milliseconds
9:00
and now our clock should
9:02
run currently this clock is in military
9:05
time although I'm recording this at 8:00
9:08
in the morning if you would like this
9:10
clock to be a 12-hour clock then at a.m
9:12
or p.m. here's the following changes
9:14
we're going to make we'll declare ours
9:17
with let instead of const so we can
9:19
change it and reassign it we'll create a
9:21
new constant of
9:23
meridium 4 a.m. or
9:27
p.m. this will equal
9:29
hours is hours greater than or equal to
9:32
12 we'll use the erary operator to check
9:35
this if ours is greater than or equal to
9:38
12 meridium will be PM otherwise it will
9:43
be
9:45
am then after our
9:48
meridium we'll reassign hours hours
9:52
equals
9:53
hours modulus modulus gives you the
9:56
remainder of any division ours modul 12
10:00
if this is zero we'll use the or logical
10:03
operator or 12 after seconds we'll add a
10:07
placeholder for our
10:11
meridium currently we lost our padding
10:13
for the hours so we're going to cut this
10:16
part of our code to convert ours to a
10:19
string and Pad
10:21
it we'll take hours equals hours to
10:25
reassign it follow hours with converting
10:28
it to a string using the two string
10:29
method and Pad it before displaying
10:33
it all right and that has appeared to
10:35
work all right everybody so that is a
10:38
digital clock program you can make using
10:40
HTML CSS and
10:46
JavaScript
