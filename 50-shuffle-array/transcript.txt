hey everybody in today's video I'm going
0:01
to show you how we can Shuffle the
0:03
elements of an array using JavaScript
0:05
this is an optional video you might find
0:07
this topic helpful if you're interested
0:08
in making a game using JavaScript or any
0:11
sort of application where you need some
0:12
Randomness in this example we'll create
0:14
a deck of cards our deck of cards will
0:16
be an array we have an a for Ace the
0:18
numbers 2 through 10 let me finish
0:21
typing those
0:22
in J for Jack Q for Queen k for King I'm
0:28
not going to include any suits for these
0:30
cards such as Ace of Hearts Ace of clubs
0:33
that might be overkill for this example
0:36
one method you might see floating around
0:37
online to shuffle the elements of an
0:39
array is to use the sort method then
0:42
pass in an arrow function where you take
0:44
math.random minus 0.5 I would not
0:47
recommend using this method just because
0:50
the results of this method aren't
0:51
perfectly uniform let me console.log
0:54
cards this array appears shuffled but
0:57
it's not that uniform but not only that
0:59
the Lar larger the array becomes this
1:01
method becomes increasingly more
1:03
inefficient I would not recommend using
1:05
the sort method to shuffle an array
1:07
instead I would recommend using the fer
1:10
Yates algorithm we'll create a dedicated
1:12
function for
1:14
this so we will Define a function to
1:17
shuffle there will be one parameter an
1:21
array then to invoke this function we'll
1:24
type the function name pass an our array
1:26
of
1:27
cards so what do we want to do exactly
1:30
we're first going to Loop through the
1:32
elements of this array we'll start at
1:34
the end and work our way towards the
1:36
beginning we'll use a for Loop to
1:38
decrement So within our Shuffle function
1:40
we'll create a for Loop we will declare
1:44
index of I let I equal R array do
1:50
length then minus one that's the first
1:53
statement our array has 13 elements but
1:56
the last index is 12 because arrays
1:58
start with zero if the array's length is
2:01
13 we need to subtract 1 to get 12 which
2:04
would give us the ending index of 12
2:06
we'll continue this loop as long as I is
2:09
greater than
2:10
zero then iusus to decrement now we have
2:15
to generate a random number between the
2:17
end and the beginning somewhere within
2:19
this range we'll create const random
2:23
random will store a random number take
2:26
math. random method times
2:31
I our index + one we'll need to round
2:34
this number we're now going to enclose
2:37
this equation with math. floor to round
2:39
down math. floor and enclose this
2:44
equation all right during the first
2:47
iteration of this Loop we should
2:49
generate a random number between the end
2:52
and the beginning we'll swap our king
2:55
with a random element within this array
2:57
so to swap two elements of this array we
2:59
can use destructuring in this context to
3:02
use destructuring we'll take our
3:04
original position array at index of I
3:07
during our first iteration that will be
3:09
the king we'll swap our King with our
3:12
array at a random index the one that
3:15
will be randomly
3:16
generated equals our array at index of
3:20
random comma array at index of
3:24
I then to finish using destructuring we
3:27
need to enclose both sides of this
3:29
equation with with an
3:31
array there and that will swap two
3:33
elements of your
3:34
array now if I run this program this
3:37
will Shuffle the elements of my array I
3:40
would recommend using a dedicated
3:41
Shuffle function because in a game it's
3:44
likely you're going to shuffle something
3:46
more than once throughout that game like
3:48
I said this isn't a necessary topic to
3:50
continue on with the series but if
3:52
you're ever interested in making a game
3:54
using JavaScript or need some element of
3:56
Randomness well then this function would
3:58
work great and that is how to to shuffle
4:00
the elements of an array using
4:03
JavaScript
