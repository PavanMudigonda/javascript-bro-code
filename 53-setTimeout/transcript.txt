introduction

hey what's going on people so in today's
0:02
video I'm going to explain the set
0:03
timeout function in JavaScript the set
0:06
timeout function allows you to schedule
0:08
the execution of a function after an
0:10
amount of time in milliseconds the times
0:13
are approximate they vary based on the
0:15
workload of your JavaScript runtime
0:17
environment I wouldn't recommend using
0:19
set timeout for anything precise like a
0:21
stopwatch it's an approximation to use
0:24
the set timeout function you pass in a
0:26
call back to a function and a delay in
0:28
milliseconds here's an example Le I will
setTimeout w/ callback
0:31
create a function to say
0:34
hello all we're going to do is window.
0:38
alert the word
0:43
hello I will use the set timeout
0:47
function pass in a call
0:49
back we'll pass in a call back to say
0:52
hello then execute it after 3,000
0:55
milliseconds so 3 seconds let's see if
0:58
this works 1 2 3 hello an anonymous
setTimeout w/ anonymous functions
1:05
function works too so instead of a
1:07
callback we'll use an anonymous
1:09
function function parenthesis curly
1:14
braces window.
1:17
alert the word
1:20
hello 1 1000 2 1000 3 1000 hello or even
setTimeout w/ arrow funcitons
1:26
an arrow function we have parameters
1:30
Arrow what are we going to do window.
1:34
alert the word
1:38
hello 1 1000 2 1000 3 1,000 hello you
clearTimeout()
1:44
can use the clear timeout function to
1:46
cancel a timeout before it triggers but
1:49
we have to pass in a Timeout ID so what
1:53
we'll do with this set timeout function
1:56
is assign it to an ID stored within a
1:58
variable or constant
2:01
const time out
2:05
ID equals our set timeout function
2:09
that'll display the word hello I can
2:11
clear this timeout with the clear
2:14
timeout function but I have to pass in
2:16
that ID as an
2:18
argument immediately after calling the
2:20
set timeout function we will cancel it
2:24
let's try it 1 1000 2 1000 3 1000 yeah
2:30
nothing's happening we canceled it all
start button
2:32
right what we'll do this time is create
2:34
a button using HTML when we click on the
2:37
button we'll set a timeout to display
2:39
the word
2:40
hello
2:43
so let's clear all of this go to our
2:46
HTML file we'll create a
2:50
button the button will have text of
2:54
start and I'm going to zoom
2:57
in I will set the onclick attribute to
3:02
equal a function we will start a timer
3:06
then add a set of
3:08
parentheses when we click on the button
3:10
do this function So within our
3:13
Javascript file we will create a start
3:16
timer
3:18
function function start
3:22
timer we will set time
3:26
out I'll use an arrow function
3:31
let's
3:32
window. alert the word we will display
3:36
the word hello after 3,000
3:39
milliseconds all right so nothing's
3:41
going to happen until I click the button
3:44
I'm going to click it now 1 1,000 2
3:47
1,000 3 1,000
3:50
hello let's create a second button to
clear button
3:53
clear the timeout if we need to stop it
3:56
let's copy our first button paste it
4:01
change the text of the button to be
4:03
clear we will clear the timeout but
4:05
we'll need another
4:07
function clear
4:12
timer so there's our second button we'll
4:15
need a timeout ID so outside of this
4:18
function I will declare a variable of
4:21
let time out
4:25
ID when we start our timer we will
4:28
assign the set time out function an ID
4:32
of timeout
4:33
ID then we can stop it using this
4:36
ID we will create a function to clear
4:40
the
4:42
timer we're going to use the clear
4:44
timeout function clear time
4:48
out we need to pass out a timeout ID as
4:51
an argument which we will do and then
4:55
just to be sure that everything works
4:56
within both these functions let's
4:58
console.log something let's say the word
5:02
started within our start timer and
5:05
within our clear timer let's display the
5:07
word cleared just so we know that these
5:10
functions were called so I'm going to
5:13
save
5:14
everything I'm going to start the timer
5:16
but not clear it let's start now 1 1000
5:21
2 1000 3 1000 hello let's go to our
5:26
console and it says that we started well
5:29
starter I clearly can't spell today
5:32
started we're going to start then
5:36
cancel start 1 1000 2 1000
5:40
clear and nothing happened let's go to
5:43
our console inspect console we started
5:46
set timeout and then we cleared
conclusion
5:49
it all right everybody that is the set
5:51
timeout function it's a function in
5:53
JavaScript that allows you to schedule
5:56
the execution of a function after an
5:58
amount of time in milliseconds
6:00
execution time may vary based on the
6:01
workload of the JavaScript runtime
6:03
environment and well everybody that is
6:06
the set timeout function in
6:11
JavaScript
