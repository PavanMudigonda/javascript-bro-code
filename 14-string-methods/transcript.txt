hey it's me again so today I'm going to
0:02
explain string Methods in JavaScript
0:04
string Methods allow you to manipulate
0:07
and work with text also known as strings
0:10
in this example I have a username
0:12
username equals a string of text why
0:16
don't you go ahead and create a username
0:17
variable and set it equal to either your
0:19
username if you have one or your full
0:22
name strings have different built-in
0:24
methods where we can manipulate this
0:27
text one way or another here's a few
charAt()
0:29
examples suppose I would like to get the
0:31
first character of the string I can use
0:35
the Char at method type a string or a
0:38
variable containing a string then follow
0:40
this with DOT by adding a DOT we are
0:43
accessing any Properties or methods that
0:46
the string has follow this with Char at
0:50
then list an index the first character
0:53
is zero the second character would be
0:55
one so get the character at index zero
0:59
that that should be a b however if I
1:01
were to run this let's go to our Dev
1:04
tools uh nothing appears to happen
1:07
because it's going to return a single
1:08
character let's place that within
1:11
console.log just so that we can see
1:13
it cut this code and paste it within
1:17
console.log so the first character in my
1:20
string is B but depending on what you
1:23
wrote it might be different for you the
1:25
character at index one would be R then
1:30
is O so that is the Char at
1:33
method the index of method will return
indexOf()
1:37
the index of the first occurrence of a
1:39
character let's find the first
1:41
occurrence of an O it will return an
1:44
index and then again I have to
1:47
console.log whatever is
1:50
returned so let's place this method
1:53
within
1:55
console.log what is the index of the
1:57
first occurrence of an o that would be 2
2:01
0 1 2 otherwise for the last index let's
lastIndexOf()
2:05
change the method to be last index of
2:09
which would be four 0 1 2 3
length
2:15
4 so the length property this isn't a
2:17
method to get the length of a string
2:20
type the string or a variable containing
2:23
the
2:23
string dot length this isn't a method
2:28
but it's very similar so the length of
2:31
my username is seven characters 1 2 3 4
2:35
5 6 7 so that's how to get the length of
2:39
a
trim()
2:40
string now we are going to trim the
2:42
string maybe there's a bunch of white
2:44
spaces after or
2:47
before I will reassign username equal to
2:51
let's take our username variable Dot and
2:54
use the trim method to trim any wh
2:57
space then I will console
3:00
dolog my
3:03
username there's my name and there's no
3:05
Whit space
3:07
after let's add some white space before
3:10
our name yep and there's no white
toUpperCase()
3:13
space to make my name I'll uppercase I
3:16
can use the two uppercase method now my
3:21
string is all
toLowerCase()
3:22
uppercase then there's two lowercase to
3:25
make all of the characters
repeat()
3:28
lowercase there's repeat to repeat a
3:31
string within the parenthesis of the
3:34
method how many times do you want to
3:36
repeat the string if I were to type
3:38
three we'll repeat the string three
3:41
times to determine if a string starts
startWith()
3:44
with a given character we can use the
3:45
starts with method this will return a
3:48
Boolean I will store that within a
3:50
result
3:51
variable username
3:55
do starts with method we we will check
4:00
to see if the string starts with an
4:02
empty
4:03
space then let's
4:06
console.log the
4:09
result that is false my username does
4:11
not begin with the space but what if it
4:14
did I'll add one then that returns true
4:17
this could be useful within an if
4:20
statement if
4:23
result if the string starts with a whit
4:26
space let's
4:28
console.log
4:30
your
4:32
username can't begin
4:35
with an empty
4:38
space else let's
4:45
console.log the
4:47
username my username has a whit space in
4:49
the beginning your username can't begin
4:52
with Whit
4:53
space if that were false then we will
4:56
display my username so that is the
4:58
starts withth method
endsWith()
5:00
there's also ends
5:05
with does my username end with the Whit
5:08
space it does not but what if it
5:12
did your username can't end with an
5:16
empty
5:17
space next is the includes method does
includes()
5:21
the string contain an empty
5:23
space I'll split my username into two
5:26
your first and last name would work as
5:28
well your username
5:31
can't include an empty space currently
5:34
it does your username can't include an
5:37
empty space if it didn't then we pass
5:40
the test we will display the
replaceAll()
5:43
username all right now this time we will
5:45
create a phone number let phone number
5:50
equals make up some phone number
5:51
including dashes 1 2 3 4 5 6
5:57
7890 so this phone number is a string
6:00
even though it contains numbers because
6:02
strings can contain numbers but we treat
6:04
them as
6:05
characters let's eliminate all the
6:07
dashes in our phone number here's one
6:09
way in which we can do that let's
6:11
reassign our phone number equals our
6:15
phone number we will use the replace all
6:20
method which character are we replacing
6:23
let's replace any dashes comma then the
6:26
character to replace the dashes with or
6:29
whatever you put for the first
6:30
character we will replace all dashes
6:33
with no
6:35
characters then let's console. log our
6:38
phone number and that should eliminate
6:41
all of the
6:43
dashes or otherwise you could replace it
6:45
with a different character let's do a
6:46
forward slash so 1
6:52
234567890 there's also the pad start
padStart()
6:55
method. pad
6:58
start
7:00
the first value within the pad start
7:02
method is a specified length how many
7:05
characters should the string be I would
7:08
like the string to be 15 characters long
7:11
then for the second value make sure to
7:13
comma separate it we can pad the start
7:16
of the string with a given character
7:18
let's say
7:20
zero so the result is a couple zeros
7:23
than our phone
7:24
number pad this string with zeros until
7:28
it's 15 character long if I were to set
7:31
this to 20 then we would have more zeros
7:34
there's more
padEnd()
7:35
padding then there's pad
7:38
end pad the end of the string with this
7:41
character until the string is 15
7:43
characters
conclusion
7:45
long all right everybody so those are
7:47
string Methods they allow you to
7:49
manipulate and work with text also known
7:52
as strings we'll have more practice with
7:54
these in the future and well those are a
7:56
few useful string Methods in JavaScript
