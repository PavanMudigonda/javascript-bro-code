introduction

all right what's going on people so
0:01
today I'm going to discuss for Loops a
0:03
for Loop will repeat some code a limited
0:06
amount of times with the while loop a
0:09
while loop can repeat some code
0:10
infinitely with the for Loop we can do
0:12
something a certain or limited amount of
0:14
times here's an example let's say we
increment
0:17
would like to display the word hello
0:18
three times with the for Loop we can
0:21
write something like this now to create
0:23
a for Loop Type 4 parentheses curly
0:25
braces within the set of parentheses we
0:28
have up to three statements the first is
0:30
that we can create a temporary counter
0:32
much like we're assigning a variable
0:34
let's create a counter named I let I I
0:37
is a common naming convention for
0:40
counters within a loop I'm meaning index
0:42
so let I equal what number would we like
0:46
to start at let's start at zero then
0:49
semicolon this is the first statement
0:51
we'll create a counter to keep track of
0:54
the number of iterations the next
0:56
statement is the condition in which we
0:58
continue the for Loop we will continue
0:59
this for loop as long as I is less than
1:02
or equal to two that's if we're going to
1:06
execute this for loop three times zero
1:09
one two that would be a total of three
1:11
then the third statement we can
1:13
increment or decrement our counter I so
1:16
let's increment our counter by wandering
1:18
each iteration by typing I plus plus and
1:21
that's a for loop I is set to zero will
1:24
continue as long as I is less than or
1:26
equal to 2 then during each iteration we
1:29
will increment I by one that means we
1:31
will execute this for loop three times
1:33
what are we going to do when we execute
1:35
each iteration
1:38
let's console.log
1:40
hello
1:42
so this should display the word hello
1:44
three times yep hello three
1:47
now if I were to instead console.log I
1:51
we can see what I is
1:53
so during the first iteration I our
1:55
counter is zero then one then two if I
1:59
wanted to count up to ten I could change
2:01
my condition to be this
2:03
I is less than
2:05
10.
2:07
so we begin at zero then we count up to
2:10
nine
2:11
so if I need 1 through 10
2:13
I'll set I in the beginning to be one
2:16
then continue as long as I is less than
2:19
or equal to ten there so we have numbers
2:22
1 through 10 using a for Loop we can
2:25
even increment by a different number
2:26
instead of incrementing our counter by
2:29
one let's increment by two so I plus
2:33
equals two so then we should count it by
2:36
twos
2:37
one three five seven nine
2:40
if I want to start at 2 I can change our
2:42
counter to start at 2. count from two to
2:45
ten but increment by two
2:48
four six eight ten if we would like to
decrement
2:51
count down let's start at 10 then count
2:54
down to zero
2:55
let I equal ten
2:58
will continue as long as I is greater
3:01
than zero
3:03
then I minus minus to decrement
3:06
hey for fun after we escape the for Loop
3:09
let's console.log Happy New Year
3:13
it's as if we're counting down to
3:14
midnight on New Year's Eve
3:17
ten nine eight seven six five four three
3:20
two one Happy New Year
3:22
or we could count down by two
3:24
I minus equals two
3:28
ten eight six four two or three or
3:31
whatever number ten seven four one happy
3:34
New Year or whatever number you want
continue
3:36
now I'm gonna cover continue and break
3:40
this time we will count to twenty
3:43
we need a for Loop we'll create a
3:45
counter let I equal I'll set I to be one
3:50
that's our first statement our condition
3:52
is we'll continue as long as I is less
3:55
than or equal to twenty then increment I
3:58
by One during each iteration
4:02
so to test this let's console.log
4:05
I
4:07
so we have the numbers one through
4:09
twenty
4:11
so with continue we can skip an
4:14
iteration
4:15
I'm going to write an if statement
4:20
if I is equal to now there is a
4:24
Superstition that 13 is an unlucky
4:26
number
4:27
let's say if I is equal to 13 we will
4:30
skip that iteration I know it's a weird
4:32
example so if I is equal to 13
4:36
let's continue
4:38
we'll skip this iteration of the loop
4:42
else we will console.log whatever I is
4:47
so now when I run this program when I
4:49
run this program we skip over 13 we jump
4:52
from 12 to 14.
4:54
so if you ever need to skip an iteration
4:56
you can use the continue keyword
break
4:59
now there's break break will break out
5:02
of the loop entirely we've seen this
5:04
keyword in switches to break out of the
5:06
switch if I equals 13 then just exit the
5:10
for Loop entirely so in this example we
5:13
count up to 12 but since I it now equals
5:16
13 we break out of the loop entirely
5:19
we don't continue the rest of the
5:20
iterations
conclusion
5:22
all right everybody so those are for
5:23
Loops you can repeat some code a limited
5:26
amount of times there's up to three
5:28
statements we can write we can create a
5:31
temporary variable that serves as a
5:33
counter a condition in which we should
5:35
continue
5:36
then we can increment or decrement our
5:38
counter and those are four Loops in
5:41
