hey what's going on everybody in this
0:01
video we're going to create a number
0:03
guessing game using JavaScript so why
0:05
don't you go ahead and sit back relax
0:07
and enjoy the show all right let's get
0:09
started everybody so the first thing
0:11
that we're going to need is to set the
0:12
minimum and the maximum numbers in our
0:14
number guessing game so we'll create two
0:17
constants const minum for the
0:21
minimum I will set my minimum to be one
0:24
but feel free to pick a different number
0:25
if you would like then a maximum const
0:29
Maxum
0:30
I will set my maximum to be 100 so what
0:33
we got to do is generate a random number
0:35
between our minimum and our maximum
0:38
inclusively so let's create another
0:40
constant const answer then we'll
0:44
generate a random number between one and
0:46
100 our minimum and our maximum to do
0:49
that we can type math.
0:51
random the random method of math will
0:54
generate a random number between zero
0:56
and one we will multiply this by within
0:59
a set of parentheses the range between
1:02
our maximum minus our
1:05
minimum then add plus
1:07
one let's see what we have so far just
1:10
to test everything I'm going to
1:13
console.log our
1:16
answer okay let's inspect go to console
1:20
here's my answer currently 56 point and
1:23
then a bunch of decimal places after I
1:25
will round our answer by enclosing this
1:28
equation with math. to round
1:31
down okay let's see what we get again 39
1:36
899 20 71 27 17 46 okay that seems like
1:41
it's working what if we have a higher
1:44
minimum let's say between 50 and
1:49
100 well I have 7 22 43 numbers that are
1:54
below our minimum so if we have a
1:56
minimum besides one I will add to the
1:59
the end of this equation our minimum
2:02
again okay let's see if that works so if
2:05
I need a random number between 50 and
2:07
100 this equation should work 97 80 79
2:12
52 all right that seems like it's
2:14
working so this is the equation you'll
2:16
need to generate a random number between
2:18
your minimum that you set and your
2:20
maximum but let's change our minimum
2:22
back to one and make sure our maximum is
2:25
100 all right let's move on to step two
2:28
we'll create a variable name attempts to
2:31
keep track of the attempts it takes a
2:32
user I will set attempts to be zero and
2:36
let
2:38
guess I will declare this variable but
2:40
not assign it quite yet we'll take care
2:42
of that later I will also create a
2:44
Boolean variable named running and I
2:46
will set this to be
2:48
true the reason that we have the Boolean
2:50
variable running is so that we can exit
2:53
the game when it's over we'll set
2:55
running to equal false so to keep the
2:57
game running we'll use a while loop
3:00
while running equals true now if this is
3:04
a Boolean variable you don't necessarily
3:06
need this portion equals true you can
3:09
just set this to be while
3:11
running while this Boolean is true keep
3:15
the game going then when we want to exit
3:17
the game we will set running to equal
3:21
false so that will be at the
3:23
end now we need to accept some user
3:26
input I'll do this with the window
3:28
prompt we will set our guest to equal
3:33
window.
3:35
prompt I'll use a template
3:39
literal guess a
3:41
number
3:43
between I'll add a
3:45
placeholder our
3:48
minimum through add another placeholder
3:51
our
3:53
maximum all right to test this I'm going
3:55
to
3:58
console.log
4:00
the type of
4:02
guess as well as what guess is there's
4:04
something I need to show you guess I
4:06
number between one and 100 I'll guess
4:08
something right in the middle 50 let's
4:11
inspect go to console so my user input
4:14
of 50 is a string data type we'll need
4:17
to convert it to a number for
4:20
comparisons so after we get our guess
4:23
let's reassign it and typ cast it as a
4:26
number
4:28
type let's let's try that again guess a
4:30
number between 1 and 100 I'll type 50
4:33
okay inspect console we have our guess
4:37
of 50 and it's a number data type what
4:39
if you were to type in something that
4:41
wasn't a number like a string of
4:43
characters such as
4:45
Pizza here's the
4:48
result if you type cast some characters
4:50
that are non-numeric you know the number
4:53
0 through 9 you'll end up with not a
4:55
number Pizza can't be converted to a
4:57
number unfortunately I will delete this
5:00
line of code we no longer need it I'll
5:02
add an if statement there's a function
5:05
to check to see if something is not a
5:07
number is not a number
5:10
function if our guess is not a number if
5:14
this evaluates to be true let's add an
5:17
alert window.
5:21
alert please enter a valid
5:26
number guess a number between 1 and 100
5:29
What if I type
5:30
pizza please enter a valid number now
5:33
what if somebody types in a guess that's
5:35
below our minimum or above our maximum
5:38
I'll add an else if
5:40
statement else if our guess is below our
5:46
minimum or our guess is above our
5:52
maximum will window. alert please enter
5:56
a valid number again guess a number
5:58
between 1 and 100 what if I type in 150
6:02
that's above our maximum please enter a
6:04
valid
6:05
number please enter a number between 1
6:07
and
6:08
1001 please enter a valid number if the
6:11
user's guess is a number and it's
6:15
between our range between the minimum
6:16
and the
6:19
maximum we'll execute an L statement if
6:22
they reach the L statement that means
6:24
they have a valid number we'll increase
6:26
our attempts variable by one attempts
6:29
Plus plus to increment
6:32
it if the
6:35
guess if the guess is less than the
6:39
answer then will window.
6:44
alert too low try
6:52
again else if the guess is greater than
6:56
the
6:58
answer will window.
7:01
alert to high try again if the guess
7:05
isn't lower than the answer and the
7:07
guess isn't higher than the answer that
7:09
means the guess must equal the answer
7:12
within an else
7:14
statement we'll congratulate the user
7:17
they have the right answer
7:18
window.
7:22
alert
7:25
correct the
7:28
answer was
7:30
and I should probably use a template
7:32
literal for this if we're inserting
7:34
variables the
7:38
answer we'll let the user know how many
7:40
attempts it took it took
7:44
you the variable
7:46
attempts then the word
7:52
attempts at the end of our lse statement
7:54
we'll move running equals false to
7:57
within the lse statement at the end to
7:59
ex at the game we no longer want to play
8:01
once we have the correct answer all
8:03
right and this should work let's try it
8:06
guess a number between 1 and 100 I'll
8:09
guess something right in the middle 50
8:11
too low try again okay so the answer is
8:14
between 50 and 100 75 too high so it's
8:19
between 50 and
8:20
75
8:22
62 too
8:24
low
8:26
68 too high so it's between 62 and
8:31
68
8:33
65 too
8:35
high 63 too
8:38
low
8:40
64 yeah correct the answer was 64 it
8:43
took you seven attempts and we can exit
8:47
all right everybody so that is a number
8:49
guessing game in
8:52
