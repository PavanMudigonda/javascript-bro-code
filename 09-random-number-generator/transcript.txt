Math.random()
0:00
hey what's going on everybody so in
0:01
today's video we're going to create a
0:03
random number generator but first I need
0:05
to explain how to create a random number
0:07
in JavaScript let's store a random
0:09
number within a variable which we will
0:11
name random num
0:14
to create a random number in JavaScript
0:16
we can use the random method of math
0:19
math dot random method this will
0:22
generate a random number between 0 and
0:25
1. but it looks like we forgot to Output
0:28
our random number so let's do that with
0:31
console.log
0:32
console.log randomnum this will generate
0:35
a random number between 0 and 1. it will
0:38
give us a number with a long decimal
0:40
portion most likely let's say we would
0:43
like to roll a six-sided dice I need a
0:45
random number between one and six not
0:48
including the decimal portion so the
0:50
first step is that we will multiply
0:53
math.random times six
0:56
what this will do is give us a random
0:58
number between 0 and 6 exclusive now I
1:01
don't want the decimal portion I would
1:03
like a whole integer we'll enclose this
1:05
equation with the floor method of math
1:09
dot floor then we will enclose our
1:12
equation
1:14
so now we have
1:15
oops it looks like I misspelled math it
1:17
should be Capital there so far a random
1:20
number is going to be between zero and
1:22
five so they're zero
1:25
and there's five
1:28
but I need one through six well we can
1:30
increase the minimum by adding plus one
1:32
or whatever you want the minimum to be
1:34
so now that should give us a random
1:37
number between one and six
1:40
there's six
1:43
and there's one
1:44
for a random number between 1 and 100 I
1:47
can set the maximum to be 100
1:49
math.random times one hundred plus one
1:53
so now the number is going to be between
1:55
1 and 100.
1:57
if you're looking for a random number
1:59
between a certain range let's say 50 and
2:01
100
2:03
well we're going to change our equation
2:05
just to make this easier to read I'm
2:07
going to set two constants const Min
2:10
what's the minimum let's say 50. and the
2:13
max const max will be 100.
2:17
let's replace 100 with our maximum and
2:21
one with our minimum there's one
2:23
additional change we need to make for
2:25
example our random number is 139
2:29
we're multiplying math.random times 100
2:33
our maximum then adding an additional 50
2:36
to it
2:37
so one change we're going to make is
2:39
that we will subtract our minimum from
2:42
our maximum then I will surround this
2:44
portion of our equation with the set of
2:46
parentheses just to force operator
2:47
precedence now the random number should
2:50
be between 50 and 100 so depending on
2:53
the range of numbers you're looking for
2:54
you can change the minimum and the
2:56
maximum all right now with that out of
random number generator
2:58
the way let's create our random number
3:00
generator
3:01
let's go to our HTML file I will create
3:04
a button
3:07
the ID will be my button the text on the
3:11
button will be roll we will roll a
3:14
six-sided dice
3:15
within our CSS style sheet
3:18
I will set the text of the body of our
3:21
document
3:22
the font family I will set to be verdana
3:26
because I like that font
3:29
to Center align everything to make this
3:31
easy I will set text aligned Center
3:35
all right we're getting somewhere
3:37
let's work on the button I will select
3:39
the ID of my button
3:42
I will change the font size of the
3:44
button to be 3 em meaning 300 percent
3:48
I'll add a little bit of padding within
3:50
our button 5 pixels by 25 pixels
3:54
and I will set the Border radius to be 5
3:59
pixels
4:01
just to smooth the corners
4:03
we're also going to need a label so
4:05
let's go back to our HTML file
4:07
I will add a label
4:10
with an ID of my label
4:15
within our CSS style sheet I will select
4:18
the ID of my label then change the font
4:22
size to be 3 em
4:24
so be sure to save your CSS file
4:27
save your HTML file
4:30
then within our JavaScript file
4:33
we will need to get our button and the
4:35
label we'll store those within some
4:37
constants
4:39
const my button equals document dot get
4:44
element by ID the ID of the element
4:48
we're getting is my button
4:54
then we will need to get my label
4:57
my
4:59
label the ID is my label
5:04
let's set a minimum
5:06
const Min equals I'll set that to be one
5:10
as if we're rolling a six-sided dice
5:12
const Max equals six
5:16
then let random num will declare a
5:20
random number variable but not assign it
5:22
quite yet
5:23
okay when we click on the button
5:26
we'll execute a function
5:27
we will take my button
5:30
with the on click attribute I will set
5:33
the SQL to a function what's the
5:36
function going to do it's going to roll
5:38
a random number
5:39
random num equals math dot random times
5:45
our maximum
5:49
we'll enclose this equation with
5:51
math.floor to round it math dot floor
5:56
then add our minimum
5:59
then we will change the text content of
6:02
my label to display it my label dot text
6:06
content equals our randomnum
6:10
when we click on the button it should
6:12
roll a random number
6:14
uh what are we missing not a number
6:17
oh okay it looks like I made a mistake I
6:19
forgot to add a set of parentheses after
6:21
random
6:22
there we go
6:24
I'm going to put the number on a new
6:25
line so within our HTML file I'm just
6:27
going to add a Break Tag
6:30
there we go let's save everything roll
6:32
again so I rolled a six three one two
6:35
five three
multiple random numbers
6:37
let's say we would like to roll three
6:39
dice not just one we'll make a few
6:41
changes
6:43
I will replace my label with label one
6:46
for the ID
6:48
then I'm going to add a break after okay
6:51
let's copy our label paste it two times
6:54
we'll need labels two and three
6:58
I'll also give these labels a class of
7:01
my labels
7:04
we can apply CSS styling to an entire
7:06
class to make it easy
7:08
all right within our CSS style sheet
7:11
let's replace the ID of my label with
7:13
the class of my labels
7:18
be sure to save all of your files
7:20
than within our Javascript file let's
7:24
replace my label with label one
7:27
the ID is label one
7:30
copy this line of code
7:32
then we need labels two and three
7:34
label two
7:36
label three
7:39
let's rename randomnum as random num1
7:44
copy it paste it two times then we need
7:47
random number two random number three
7:51
within our function for our button
7:53
change random num to be random num1 copy
7:56
this line paste it two times
7:59
then we need random number two random
8:01
number three
8:03
we'll change the text content of my
8:05
label to be label one
8:08
equals random num1 copy this line paste
8:12
it two times change one to B2
8:15
then for the third line change one to be
8:18
three
8:19
what we'll do now is generate three
8:21
random numbers between one and six as if
8:24
we're rolling three dice
8:25
two three two three six one two two five
8:29
all right everybody that's how to create
8:30
a random number generator in JavaScript
