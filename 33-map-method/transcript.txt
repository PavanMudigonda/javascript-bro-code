hey it's me again today I got to explain
0:02
the map method in JavaScript the map
0:04
method accepts a callback and applies
0:07
that function to each element of an
0:09
array it's very similar to the for each
0:11
method however it returns a new array
0:14
that's a key difference for example
example 1
0:17
let's create an array of constants I'm
0:19
picking constants just to demonstrate
0:21
that we're not changing any elements in
0:22
this array we have const numbers I'll
0:26
select the numbers 1 through 5 to keep
0:28
it simple I will create a function to
0:31
square each
0:32
number function
0:35
Square we have one parameter we have an
0:38
element all I'm going to do is return
0:43
math.pow this will raise a base to a
0:46
given power we are raising our element
0:49
to the power of two then returning it
0:52
we're going to take our array of numbers
0:54
use the built-in map method then pass in
0:58
our function as a call back the map
1:00
method will return a new array we will
1:03
create a new array to store the values
1:04
that are returned so I will create
1:08
const
1:10
squares equals numbers. map and then
1:14
let's display our squares I'll use
1:17
console.log for now
1:19
console.log R squares here are all the
1:23
numbers squared 1 4 9 16 25 let's create
1:27
a function to cube these numbers now
1:30
we'll copy and paste our Square function
1:33
but change it to cube we'll raise our
1:36
element to the power of
1:38
three const cubes equals take our
1:43
original array numbers dot use the map
1:46
method pass in a call back to the
1:48
function we would like to use
1:50
Cube then we will console.log rray of
1:54
cubes and we have some new numbers 1 8
1:58
27 64 125 the map method is very similar
2:02
to four each but after completion the
2:05
map method returns a new array we still
2:08
have our original numbers whereas in
2:10
four each will'll change them that's a
2:12
key difference let's go over a new
example 2
2:14
example we'll create an array of
2:17
students const students
2:21
equals for my first student I will pick
2:25
SpongeBob then
2:28
Patrick
2:31
Squidward Sandy that's good enough I
2:34
will create a function to make all of
2:36
these strings
2:38
uppercase
2:40
function
2:42
uppercase there is a single element
2:45
remember the element is going to be
2:47
provided for us with the map method
2:49
element index and array but we only need
2:51
element in this case I will return our
2:55
element dot to uppercase method
3:00
and that's it we'll create a new
3:04
array students what can we name this uh
3:08
students upper I suppose we will take
3:12
our array of students use the Bap method
3:16
pass in the function we would like to
3:18
apply as a
3:19
callback then I will
3:23
console.log students
3:26
upper within my array all of the
3:29
students names are all uppercase let's
3:31
create a function for
3:34
lowercase function lowercase to
3:38
lowercase I will create a new array
3:42
const
3:43
students lower equals the name of the
3:47
array
3:48
students map pass in our function as a
3:51
call
3:51
back then display the array of students
3:55
lower now all of the names are now
3:57
lowercase all right third example
example 3
4:00
this one is more practical we'll create
4:03
an array of dates const dates
4:07
equals certain regions will order their
4:10
dates differently for example you might
4:12
have the year followed by a month then a
4:16
day we're going to rearrange the order
4:19
of these dates using the map method so
4:22
come up with a few dates I picked 2024
4:25
January 10th
4:28
2025 February
4:32
20th
4:34
2026 March 30th feel free to rearrange
4:39
these however you want I will create a
4:41
function to
4:43
format
4:46
dates we have one parameter a single
4:49
element within this function I will
4:51
create a temporary array named Parts
4:55
we're going to split each state into
4:57
parts and store it within an array
4:59
within this function const Parts equals
5:04
element. split we are going to split
5:08
each element but where we are going to
5:11
split at each dash for example with my
5:14
first element we'll split this date into
5:17
2024 that will be the first element 1
5:20
and 10 then we'll reformat these parts I
5:23
will return a template string so I'm
5:27
going to need some
5:28
placeholders
5:30
so dollar sign curly braces let's take
5:33
our array of parts at index of one that
5:38
will be the month I live in the United
5:40
States we arrange our dates with month
5:43
then day then year I will place my month
5:47
first forward slash let's include
5:50
another
5:51
placeholder Parts at index of two that
5:55
will be the day of the month
5:58
slash
6:00
Parts at
6:03
index0 that will be the year we will
6:06
create a new
6:07
array
6:09
const
6:11
formatted dates equals take our original
6:15
array dates use the map
6:18
method then pass the function name as a
6:21
callback then after I will
6:24
console.log our formatted
6:27
dates and here they are for me the dates
6:30
are now January 10th 2024 February 2nd
6:33
2025 March 30th 2026 feel free to
6:37
arrange these however you like all right
6:40
everybody that is the map method it's
6:42
very similar to the for each method the
6:44
math method accepts a callback and
6:46
applies that function to each element of
6:48
an array however it returns a new array
6:50
when it's finished that's nice if you
6:52
need to preserve the original array that
6:54
the elements came from and well
6:56
everybody that is the map method in
6:58
JavaScript
