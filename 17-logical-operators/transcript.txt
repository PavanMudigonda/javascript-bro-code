hey y'all it's Ami so today I'm going to
0:03
explain logical operators there's three
0:05
of them and or not they're used to
0:09
combine or manipulate Boolean values
0:11
Boolean values if you remember are true
0:14
or false
0:15
let's create a program const temp
0:18
meaning temperature
0:20
what I would like to do is see if my
0:22
temperature Falls within a certain range
0:24
this will be in Celsius let's say the
0:26
temperature is 28 degrees Celsius
0:30
without using any logical operators
0:32
let's write this
0:34
if
0:36
our temp
0:37
is greater than zero
0:40
then we will console DOT log
0:44
the weather is good
0:49
else if
0:52
the temperature
0:54
is less than or equal to 30 30 degrees
0:58
Celsius we will also output the weather
1:01
is good
1:05
else
1:08
the weather is bad currently my
1:11
temperature is 20 degrees Celsius
1:14
the weather is good what if I were to
1:16
change this to something ridiculous like
1:18
200 degrees Celsius well the weather is
1:22
obviously not good Earth probably got
1:24
hit by an asteroid or something
1:26
or if I were to change my temperature to
1:28
like negative 100 degrees Celsius while
1:32
the weather isn't good either
1:34
I don't know maybe the sun disappeared
1:35
so what I want to do is output the
1:38
weather is good only if my temperature
1:40
Falls between the range of 0 and 30. so
1:46
we're going to change this program if
1:47
our temperature is greater than zero
1:51
and we'll check another condition
1:54
and our temperature is greater than or
1:57
equal to 30 then we can eliminate this
1:59
else if clause
2:01
now let's check the temperature
2:03
our temperature is negative 100 degrees
2:05
Celsius well the weather is bad if our
2:09
temperature was 200 degrees Celsius the
2:11
weather is also bad
2:13
in order for us to execute this if
2:15
statement
2:16
both these conditions need to be true
2:18
this one and this one to join two
2:22
conditions you use double Ampersand
2:24
meaning and
2:26
if our temperature was 25
2:29
well that falls within our range the
2:31
weather is good
2:33
this is true and this is true so we will
2:36
execute this code if one of these was
2:39
false
2:40
we don't execute it at all
2:42
we'll skip over it
2:43
so that is the andological operator
2:46
you can check more than one condition
2:49
you can check one thing and something
2:51
else
2:53
now there's or which is double straight
2:56
bars
2:57
with the orological operator at least
3:00
one of these conditions needs to be true
3:02
this has to be true or that has to be
3:05
true if I were to run the same program
3:08
well then the weather is good let's
3:10
change the temperature to 250
3:12
the weather is good but it's not it
3:15
shouldn't be
3:16
so let's rewrite this program
3:18
if our temp
3:19
is less than or equal to zero
3:24
or the temperature
3:26
is greater than 30 then the weather is
3:29
bad
3:30
else the weather is good our temperature
3:33
is 250 the weather is bad
3:37
negative 250 the weather is also bad so
3:41
with the or logical operator we're
3:43
checking more than one condition
3:45
is this true yes it is negative 250 is
3:49
less than zero
3:50
or is this condition true this one is
3:53
false
3:54
but since at least one of these is true
3:56
we will execute this code
3:58
then we will cover the notchological
4:00
operator let's create a new program
4:04
const is sunny is it sunny outside this
4:08
will be true or false
4:11
we will create an if statement
4:14
our condition will be is sunny isn't
4:17
this true if it is we will console
4:20
.log
4:23
it is sunny
4:27
else we will cancel that log
4:31
it is
4:33
cloudy
4:35
is sunny is set to true it is sunny If
4:39
This Were false
4:40
then it is cloudy using the not logical
4:43
operator we can flip a Boolean from True
4:46
to false or false to true
4:49
I will precede this Boolean with the not
4:52
logical operator which is an exclamation
4:54
point now we're checking if it's not
4:57
sunny
4:58
then we will console.log it is cloudy
5:03
else it is sunny
5:05
is it not sunny outside
5:08
it is cloudy
5:09
let's change this to be true it is sunny
5:13
so basically the not logical operator
5:15
it'll change true to be false and false
5:18
to be true alright everybody so that's a
5:20
short topic today logical operators
5:22
they're used to combine or manipulate
5:24
Boolean values use and to check to see
5:27
if at least two conditions are true with
5:30
or at least one condition needs to be
5:32
true and with not not we'll do the
5:34
opposite and well that is an
5:36
introduction to logical operators in
5:38
