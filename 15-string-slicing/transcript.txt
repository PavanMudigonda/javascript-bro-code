hey everybody so today I'm going to
0:01
explain string slicing in JavaScript
0:04
string slicing is the process of
0:06
creating a substring from a portion of
0:09
another string this won't alter the
0:11
original string just to demonstrate
0:13
let's create a constant for our full
0:16
name go ahead and type in your full name
0:20
or you can copy me I'm going to extract
0:23
the first name from my full name and
0:25
create a new string out of it so I'll
0:27
declare this let first first name equals
0:32
Now to create a substring we can follow
0:34
this formula we take our string in this
0:37
case our full name dot then use the
0:40
built-in slice
0:42
method
0:43
slice then we can list a starting and
0:46
ending index where would we like to
0:49
begin so the first character has an
0:51
index of zero we'll start at the
0:53
beginning index0 comma where are we
0:57
going to end 0 1 2
1:00
this isn't necessarily going to work and
1:03
let me demonstrate so let's
1:06
console.log our first name so my first
1:10
name is BR so the ending index is
1:13
actually exclusive in my full name we're
1:15
ending at o but we don't include it
1:17
within our substring because the ending
1:20
index is exclusive I'll increase the
1:22
ending index to three that should
1:24
include one more character which it does
1:27
now let's get the last name let
1:30
last name equals again following this
1:33
formula take our original string use the
1:37
built-in slice method State the
1:40
beginning index 0 1 2 3 4 mine will be
1:44
four yours may be different depending on
1:46
what your name is and the ending index 4
1:51
5 6 7 and remember that the last index
1:54
is exclusive so I'm going to increase
1:55
that to be eight then we'll display our
1:58
last name
2:00
console.log last
2:02
name and there's my last name so the
2:06
reason that I set the beginning index to
2:08
be four and not three is because we'll
2:10
include that space within the result as
2:13
you can see here if you're going to be
2:15
creating a substring from some position
2:17
all the way to the end you don't
2:19
necessarily need an ending index I'm
2:21
going to remove the ending index and
2:23
this should work the
2:26
same all right what if I need the first
2:28
character in the string
2:30
let first Char meaning character equals
2:36
take our string we will use the slice
2:38
method for the first character you can
2:40
use 0 comma
2:43
1 then let's display our first
2:47
character and in my example mine is B
2:50
for the last character let last
2:56
character full name do slice
3:00
we can use a negative index even if
3:02
you're using a negative index you'll
3:04
begin at the end then by decreasing the
3:07
number you'll work your way towards the
3:09
beginning so the last character in my
3:11
name is
3:13
e -2 would be
3:17
de three is OD four is c for code
3:22
negative indices work as well with these
3:25
specific numbers that I've listed
3:27
they're only going to work if my name is
3:29
exact this what if I were to change my
3:31
first name to be instead of bro broseph
3:35
like
3:36
Joseph then let's display our first name
3:39
then our last
3:43
name first name bro last name f which is
3:48
not correct to make this program more
3:51
Dynamic we can combine string slicing
3:53
with the index of method we'll search
3:56
the string for the first instance of a
3:58
space then depending on where that space
4:01
is we'll take the first part of our full
4:03
name and create a substring for the
4:05
first name anything after the space will
4:07
be our last name so let's turn these
4:10
lines into comments we don't need them
4:13
anymore let first name equals again take
4:18
our full
4:20
name do
4:23
slice we'll begin at the beginning index
4:26
zero now where do we end we're not going
4:28
to count the number of character this
4:30
time we're going to calculate it the
4:32
ending index will be take our full
4:36
name dot then use the index of
4:40
method where's the first index of a
4:45
space so that is the ending position
4:48
wherever there's a space then we'll
4:51
display our first
4:53
name uh let me get rid of our last name
4:56
there
4:58
brosive
5:00
now for the last
5:01
name let last name
5:04
equals let's copy this line of code
5:08
paste
5:09
it the beginning index will be full
5:12
name. index of
5:15
space you can list an ending index but
5:18
we don't need to we would like to
5:19
extract every character that comes after
5:21
this position so we don't need an ending
5:24
index all right let's see if this
5:26
works broi space
5:30
code we're including that space so to
5:33
remedy this I can add plus one find the
5:36
first index of a space then start in the
5:39
position after that's why we're adding
5:41
plus one then give me every letter that
5:43
comes after and that works just fine
5:46
broi code all right let's go over an
5:51
exercise this time we will list an
5:54
email const email equals why don't you
5:57
go ahead and type in your email I'll
5:59
make one up for me bro 1@gmail.com
6:04
I'll extract the first part of my email
6:08
to be stored as a
6:09
username let username equals again we're
6:14
going to take our string email do use
6:18
the slice method where are we going to
6:20
begin we'll begin at index zero that's
6:22
the beginning of a
6:23
string where will we end we'll end
6:26
wherever the at symbol is but we need to
6:28
search for it
6:30
we'll use the built-in index of method
6:32
of a string email. index of what are we
6:37
searching for we are searching for the
6:39
at
6:42
symbol and let's see if this works
6:47
console.log our
6:50
username yep bro
6:52
one then let's get the
6:56
extension let extension
7:00
equals we can copy this line of code
7:03
paste it make a few
7:05
changes this substring will begin where
7:08
the last one
7:11
ended then again
7:14
console.log the
7:17
extension at
7:19
gmail.com again like I said before I
7:21
would like to begin after this
7:24
index I will add plus
7:27
one my username is B1 my extension is
7:31
gmail.com all right everybody so that's
7:33
string slicing it's the process of
7:35
creating a substring from a portion of
7:38
another string when you create a
7:39
substring you won't alter the original
7:43
and I've proven that by setting this
7:44
string to be a constant you can't change
7:46
a constant to create a substring you
7:49
take the string use the built-in slice
7:51
method then you can list starting or
7:53
ending indices and well everybody that
7:55
is string slicing in
7:58
JavaScript
