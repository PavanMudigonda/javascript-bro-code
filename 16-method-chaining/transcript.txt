what's up everybody so in today's video
0:02
I got to explain the concept of method
0:04
chaining in JavaScript method chaining
0:07
is a programming technique it's where
0:08
you call one method after another in one
0:11
continuous line of code I'll give you
0:13
two examples of the same program one
0:15
that uses no method chaining and another
0:17
that does then we'll be able to see some
0:19
of the benefits of method chaining what
0:21
we'll do in the first version of this
0:23
program is create a variable for a
0:25
username and I will ask the user for
0:27
some input using window
0:30
prompt the text will be enter your
0:36
username after typing in some
0:39
username I would like to trim any white
0:42
space around the username take the first
0:44
character make it upper case take all of
0:47
the other characters make them all
0:49
lowercase and then display the output so
0:52
this program will have a few steps let's
0:54
reassign our username equal to
0:58
username use the trim method to remove
1:00
any Whit space before or after the name
1:03
then I will get the first character of
1:05
my username to capitalize it we'll
1:07
create a variable of let letter equals
1:12
our username follow this with the Char
1:16
at method the character at index0 letter
1:20
is going to be a variable it will hold
1:22
the first letter of my username to make
1:24
my letter uppercase I will reassign it
1:26
letter equals letter use the to
1:31
uppercase method to make that letter
1:34
uppercase now with the rest of the
1:36
characters I would like to make them
1:38
lowercase anything besides the first
1:40
character I will create a separate
1:42
variable for extra characters let's say
1:45
extra chars short for characters equals
1:49
take our original
1:51
username use the slice method we will
1:54
slice our username everything after the
1:56
first character if my name was bro code
1:59
and I cre created a slice of everything
2:00
but the first character extra characters
2:03
would be row code without the B so then
2:06
let's take our extra characters make
2:08
them all lowercase extra characters
2:10
equals extra characters followed with
2:13
the two lowercase
2:15
method then we will combine the first
2:17
letter which is uppercase and the extra
2:20
characters which are lowercase then
2:22
store them within our username username
2:25
equals our
2:27
letter plus the extra character
2:31
then we will display our
2:32
username
2:34
console.log our
2:36
username so this program does have a lot
2:39
of steps we will run this program enter
2:42
your
2:43
username I will enter a few Whit spaces
2:46
type in my name but I'll mix up the
2:52
capitalization press okay and there's my
2:55
username the first letter is uppercase
2:58
the rest of the letters are lower case
3:00
so this program does work but it is a
3:02
lot to write now with method chaining we
3:05
can combine some of these steps together
3:07
and avoid creating variables that we
3:09
don't need such as letter and extra
3:12
characters so with method training what
3:14
we'll
3:15
do is start to combine some of these
3:17
steps after getting our username we will
3:20
take our username equals take our
3:23
username again use the trim method we're
3:26
not going to end this method with a
3:27
semicolon we're going to end it with a
3:29
DOT write another method after trimming
3:31
the username get the character at index
3:34
zero and then why stop there let's
3:37
method chain again make that letter
3:40
uppercase following the two uppercase
3:42
method so this will work it's kind of
3:44
like in a video game how you can have a
3:45
combo well this is a three- hit combo
3:48
boom boom boom take our username trim it
3:51
get the first character and then make an
3:53
uppercase all in one line of code not
3:56
only that let's use some strink conation
3:59
we need to take the rest of the
4:00
characters in my username make them all
4:02
lowercase then combine them together
4:04
again let's take our username use the
4:06
trim method method chain the slice
4:10
method slice the string after the first
4:13
character then method chain again use
4:16
the two lowercase
4:20
method and that should
4:22
work
4:25
console.log my
4:27
username we're using a lot less L of
4:30
code and I'll zoom out just so you can
4:32
see
4:33
everything and to your username I'll
4:35
throw in some white spaces then mix up
4:38
the
4:42
capitalization and that has appeared to
4:44
work so that's method chaining it's a
4:47
programming technique where you can call
4:48
one method right after another in one
4:51
continuous line of code it's like a
4:53
video game combo so to say so in this
4:56
case trim our username give me the first
4:58
character and then make it uppercase we
5:01
did method chaining here here and then
5:04
we combined the results using string
5:06
catenation which is something separate
5:08
entirely by using method chaining this
5:10
helps you avoid creating named variables
5:12
but if your method chain is too long it
5:14
can become difficult to read like here I
5:17
am kind of pushing the limits and well
5:19
everybody that is Method chaining in
5:25
JavaScript
