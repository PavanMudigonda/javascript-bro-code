all right let's do this thing so I got
0:02
to talk about classes and JavaScript
0:04
classes are an es6 feature that provides
0:07
a more structured and cleaner way to
0:09
work with objects compared to the
0:11
traditional Constructor functions that
0:13
we're normally used to classes are going
0:16
to be really helpful when we reach
0:17
future topics such as the static keyword
0:20
encapsulation and inheritance in this
0:23
example I have a Constructor for a
0:25
product our product needs a name and a
0:27
price for example we have a shirt and
0:30
the price is
0:31
$19.99 instead of using a Constructor
0:33
method we're instead going to use a
0:35
class our class will include a
0:38
Constructor so let's start from the
0:40
beginning to create a class you type
0:43
class then the name of the object so our
0:46
class is going to serve as a blueprint
0:48
our objects will be products then add a
0:51
set of curly braces to use a Constructor
0:55
we can use the Constructor keyword
0:57
within our
0:58
class list any par parameters we will
1:00
have a name and a price for each product
1:04
we will assign the properties of
1:07
this.name equals the name parameter that
1:09
we
1:10
receive this. price equals price I will
1:15
also create a
1:17
function our function will be display
1:21
product now inside of a class you don't
1:23
need to use the function
1:25
keyword when we would like to display
1:28
this product we will console
1:31
log product colon space I'll include a
1:36
placeholder this.
1:39
name let's also output the
1:42
price price pick a unit of currency I'll
1:46
use American
1:48
dollars this do price let's create some
1:52
product
1:53
objects const product one equals to
1:58
create a new object we have to use that
1:59
new keyword the name of the class
2:02
product the Constructor is going to be
2:04
called automatically but we do need to
2:07
pass in a name and a price as
2:09
arguments we will pass in a shirt the
2:14
price will be
2:16
$19.99 just to be sure that everything
2:18
works let's invoke the display product
2:21
method product one do display product
2:26
method here are the details of our
2:28
product object
2:30
product shirt priced
2:33
$19.99 let's create a few more so this
2:35
class is
2:38
reusable product
2:40
two will be
2:44
pants I'll pick 2250 for the
2:48
price let's display product two product
2:51
two and we will use the display product
2:53
method of our
2:55
class product pants the price is
2:58
$22.50 uh it looks like I only have one
3:01
decimal point I'm going to make one
3:02
change after the price I will use the
3:06
two fixed method and set this to be two
3:10
decimals there
3:12
2250 all right product three const
3:15
product 3 equals new
3:19
product our third product is going to be
3:23
underwear this underwear is really
3:25
expensive it's $100 it's really good
3:27
underwear guys product 3. display
3:31
product product underwear price
3:34
$100 here's a challenge round I'm going
3:37
to add another method this method will
3:39
have one parameter sales tax we'll
3:42
create a method to calculate a total
3:44
including tax so let's create a new
3:47
method inside of a class we don't need
3:49
the function keyword calculate total
3:53
there will be one parameter sales
3:57
tax all we're going to do is return
4:01
this. Price Plus to calculate the sales
4:04
tax we'll take this. price times the
4:09
sales tax assuming it's a
4:12
percentage okay let's display product
4:15
one product one. display product I'm
4:18
also going to create a constant for the
4:19
sales tax that's not going to change
4:22
const sales tax let's say the sales tax
4:26
is 5%
4:28
0.05
4:30
I will create a variable const total
4:35
equals let's take product one use the
4:38
calculate total method but we have to
4:41
pass in sales tax we can either pass in
4:44
this number or this
4:47
variable once we have our total let's
4:49
display it
4:52
console.log I'll use a template
4:55
string total price in parentheses with t
5:02
tax I'll add a
5:04
placeholder display the total pick a
5:07
unit of currency I'll use American
5:09
dollars then I'll add two fixed two to
5:13
set it to two decimal
5:15
places all right our product is a shirt
5:18
price is $1 199.99 total price with tax
5:21
is
5:22
$20.99 let's do this with product two
5:25
product 2. display product product 2.
5:28
calculate total
5:31
pants 2250 total price
5:34
2363 let's check out our really
5:36
expensive underwear product 3. display
5:38
product product 3. calculate total our
5:42
underwear is $100 including sales tax
5:45
it's
5:47
$15 all right everybody so those are
5:49
classes they're an es6 feature that
5:51
provide a more structured and cleaner
5:53
way to work with objects compared to the
5:56
traditional Constructor functions that
5:58
we learned about in the last video
6:00
classes are going to be really helpful
6:02
with a few upcoming topics and well
6:04
everybody those are classes in
6:07
