all right before we begin everybody just
0:01
so you know this is an optional lesson
0:04
if you're ever interested in making any
0:05
sort of games in JavaScript I would
0:08
recommend learning about 2D arrays but
0:10
there are a few other uses too a 2d
0:12
array also known as a multi-dimensional
0:15
array stores a matrix of data in rows
0:18
and columns it's useful for games such
0:21
as tic-tac-toe chess Sudoku or any game
0:24
where you need a matrix or grid of data
0:27
to keep track of spaces mostly it can
0:29
also be us used in spreadsheets think of
0:31
excel Excel has rows and columns or
0:34
representing images an image is a matrix
0:37
of pixels our 2D array is going to look
0:39
something like this each row is an
0:42
individual array we're going to end up
0:44
storing all of these rows within an
0:49
array let's create one let's name our
0:52
grid this will be a constant but it
0:55
doesn't need to be Matrix we'll create a
0:58
matrix of data our 2D array is going to
1:01
store individual arrays in each
1:04
element our first array let's say we
1:06
have the numbers 1 through
1:09
three each row should be comma separated
1:13
the next row will be four five and
1:16
six then 78
1:21
9 so what we got to do is store all of
1:23
these rows within an
1:26
array and there's our 2D array to give
1:30
you a better visualization I'm going to
1:32
place each of these rows on a new
1:36
line there hopefully that makes sense
1:39
our Matrix is a 2d array each inner
1:42
array represents a row each element
1:45
within the inner arrays represent a
1:47
column 1 147 would be the first 2 58
1:51
would be the second 3 69 would be the
1:53
third if we need to print the elements
1:55
of this array here's one way in which we
1:57
can do that let's use a for Loop this
2:00
will be an enhanced for Loop let we need
2:04
some sort of counter our counter is
2:05
going to be Row for every row of our
2:10
Matrix let's begin by
2:13
console.log each row to see what we're
2:15
working with each element in the 2D
2:18
array is an array
2:20
itself however I would like to print the
2:23
individual
2:25
values we're going to create a row
2:28
string like let's use const row
2:32
string we will join all of the elements
2:35
together in each
2:37
row row doj
2:41
jooin join each element but separate
2:44
them with a space
2:45
character then console.log each row
2:49
string there's our grid we have 1 2 3 4
2:52
5 6 7 8 N9 all arranged in rows and
2:56
columns if you need to access an
2:58
individual element within this Matrix
3:00
you have to use two indices for example
3:04
let's take our 2D array of
3:08
Matrix the first index is for the row
3:12
the second index is for the column you
3:14
would think that Row one column one
3:16
would be 1 one but arrays they start
3:19
with zero the element at the first row
3:22
at the First Column would have indices
3:25
of 0
3:26
0 let's change that to be an X like
3:29
we're playing Tic-Tac
3:31
toe now we have x 2 3 so on and so forth
3:36
for the element at Row one column
3:39
2 that would be again our Matrix with
3:43
two
3:44
indices row 0 column
3:48
1 let's set that to be an
3:51
O there we are again our arrays start
3:54
with zero Row one column 2 would
3:58
translate to 0 1
4:00
let's do this with the others I think we
4:02
see a pattern now
4:05
02 Matrix at row 0 column 2 let's set
4:09
that to be an
4:10
X would be three now to move on to a
4:13
different row we have to increment our
4:16
first
4:17
index Matrix Matrix at row two would be
4:22
one column one would be zero let's set
4:26
that to be an
4:28
o that did change we're now within the
4:31
second
4:34
row 1 one would be row two column
4:40
2 row two column 3 would be 1
4:44
two okay last row again to move down to
4:48
the next row you got to increment the
4:49
first
4:51
index
4:53
Matrix Row three would be
4:55
two column 1 would be
4:58
zero we'll set seven to be an
5:05
X row three column 2 would be 2 1 that
5:09
will be an
5:14
O Row 3 column 3 would be 22 we'll set
5:18
that to be X there we are with the
5:22
length of your rows they don't
5:23
necessarily need to be all uniform for
5:26
example with my first row I'll add Z to
5:29
the
5:30
beginning so now we have 0 1 2
5:35
3 maybe I'll remove the last element in
5:38
the last
5:39
row where we just have
5:43
78 you can also mix and match data types
5:46
let's add a new row our Matrix will
5:49
represent a telephone number
5:52
pad we need a new row I'll add an
5:56
asterisk
5:58
zero and a a pound
6:01
sign there our Matrix represents a
6:04
telephone number pad all right everybody
6:06
so that's a 2d array it's a
6:09
multi-dimensional array that stores a
6:11
matrix of data in rows and columns it's
6:14
useful for games spreadsheets or
6:16
representing images we won't be using
6:18
these again until we start making some
6:20
games later on in the series and well
6:22
everybody that is an introduction to 2D
6:24
arrays and
6:28
JavaScript
