hey everybody so today I got to talk
0:01
about a sync and a weight in JavaScript
0:04
a sync and a weight are two keywords by
0:06
using these two keywords together they
0:08
allow you to write asynchronous code in
0:10
a synchronous manner a sync makes a
0:13
function return a promise a wait makes
0:16
an async function wait for a promise
0:18
we'll discuss async first in this sample
0:21
program from the last topic we have some
0:23
chores to do we have to walk the dog
0:25
clean the kitchen and take out the trash
0:28
each of these functions returns a
0:29
promise
0:30
a promise that can either resolve or
0:32
reject based on the code that's written
0:34
if the dog is walked if that's true
0:37
resolve if it's false reject a function
0:40
can be declared with a sync a function
0:42
declared with a sync will return a
0:44
promise however that promise that's
0:47
returned doesn't resolve or reject in a
0:50
way you could say it's an empty promise
0:52
if I were to run this code this is what
0:56
happens uncaught reference error resolve
0:59
is not to find if an asynchronous
1:01
function returns a promise that either
1:03
needs to resolve or reject adding a sync
1:06
to it really doesn't benefit us a sync
1:09
works together with a weight by using
1:11
these two keywords together when calling
1:13
all of these asynchronous functions in
1:15
order we don't need to Method chain then
1:17
statements there's a more synchronous
1:19
manner in which we can write the same
1:21
code but we'll need to contain it all
1:23
within an async function async function
1:28
we'll create a function to do
1:31
chores then we will need to call this
1:33
function somewhere let's do so right
1:36
here first we need to walk the dog walk
1:39
the dog returns a
1:41
promise that's where the await keyword
1:43
comes in await makes an async function
1:46
wait for a promise before continuing
1:49
we're going to create a constant of walk
1:52
dog result equals use the await
1:57
keyword await walk Dot
2:01
then we will
2:04
console.log the walk dog
2:07
result you walk the dog now let's do
2:11
this with clean kitchen we're going to
2:13
be writing this code in a synchronous
2:14
manner line by line
2:17
linearly we will create a constant for
2:19
clean kitchen result equals await the
2:23
next promise await clean
2:26
kitchen then
2:28
console.log
2:30
clean kitchen result let me close
2:34
this you walk the
2:36
dog you clean the
2:38
kitchen and last we have takeout
2:41
trash const takeout trash result equals
2:46
a wait take out the
2:49
trash then
2:53
console.log the
2:56
result you walk the
2:58
dog you clean the kitchen you take out
3:00
the trash let's add one more line when
3:03
we finish everything one more line of
3:05
code you finished all the chores you
3:09
walk the dog you clean the kitchen you
3:12
take out the trash you finished all the
3:14
chores let me show you what happens if
3:16
we attempt to use a weight within a
3:18
function not declared with
3:20
async uncaught syntax error a weight is
3:24
only valid in async functions that's why
3:27
a weight depends on async a weight makes
3:29
an async function wait for a promise
3:32
before continuing now if your promises
3:35
can reject let's say that dog walked is
3:42
false uncaught in promise you didn't
3:46
walk the dog we'll surround all of this
3:48
code within a tri block then catch any
3:58
errors catch one parameter of
4:01
error we can
4:04
console.log or console.
4:07
error the
4:09
error you didn't walk the
4:11
dog all right everybody so that is a
4:14
sync and a wait a sync makes a function
4:18
return a promise a wait makes an async
4:21
function wait for a promise by using
4:24
these two keywords together we can write
4:26
asynchronous code in a synchronous
4:29
manner
4:30
and well everybody that is a sync and a
4:32
wait in
4:37
JavaScript
