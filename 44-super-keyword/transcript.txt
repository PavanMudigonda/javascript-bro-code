intro
0:00
yo what's going on everybody so in
0:02
today's video I'm going to explain the
0:03
super keyword in JavaScript super is a
0:06
keyword that's used in classes to call
0:08
the Constructor or access the properties
0:11
and methods of a parent the parent is
0:13
also known as the super class it's very
0:16
similar to the this keyword this refers
0:18
to this object super refers to the
0:21
parent of that object here's an example
setup
0:24
we'll use inheritance to create a parent
0:26
class of animal class animal our animal
0:30
class will have three children also
0:32
known as sub classes class rabbit
0:37
extends
0:41
animal class fish extends animal class
0:46
Hawk extends
0:48
animal We'll add an empty Constructor
0:50
for now for the animal
0:53
class then we need a Constructor for the
0:56
rabbit
0:58
class
1:02
so rabbits they'll have a name property
1:06
age and a run speed we'll assign these
1:09
properties within the Constructor
1:11
this.name equals the name that we
1:13
receive this. AG equals age this.
1:18
runspeed
1:19
equals run
1:22
speed let's copy this Constructor now
1:25
with fish fish don't have a run speed
1:28
but they'll have a swim speed
1:30
let's replace run speed with swim speed
1:34
copy The Constructor again paste it
1:36
Hawks in this example won't have a swim
1:38
speed they'll have a fly speed though
1:41
replace swim speed with fly speed now
1:44
let's attempt to create some of these
1:46
objects const rabbit equals new rabbit
1:52
we need a name for this rabbit you could
1:54
just say rabbit or if you want to be
1:55
creative you could say something like
1:57
Bugs Bunny uh but let's just stick with
2:01
rabbit to keep it simple our rabbit will
2:03
be Oney old and has a run speed of 25 M
2:07
hour if you use kilometers feel free to
2:09
use kilometers let's do this with
2:13
fish const fish equals new
2:17
fish the name of our fish will be fish
2:21
our fish is 2 years old and has a swim
2:23
speed of 12
2:25
mph then with Hawk const Hawk equal
2:29
equals New Hawk our Hawk will have a
2:32
name of Hawk our Hawk will be 3 years
2:35
old and has a fly speed of 50 m hour so
super constructor
2:39
when I run this program we have an
2:41
uncaught reference error must call Super
2:43
Constructor in derived class before
2:46
accessing the this keyword so what
2:48
JavaScript is telling us is that before
2:50
we can use the this keyword we have to
2:53
call the Constructor of the parent the
2:55
super class within each of these
2:57
respective Constructors we will invoke
3:00
The Constructor of the parent the super
3:02
class with the super keyword so let's do
3:05
that for each of these
3:08
Constructors now our program actually
3:10
runs now so one of the benefits of using
3:12
Constructors is that if there's any
3:14
properties that the children all share
3:16
in common we can send them to the
3:18
Constructor of the parent as you can see
3:20
we're repeating ourselves a lot each of
3:22
these children classes has a name and
3:24
age property that we're assigning to
3:26
each we would like to follow the drve
3:28
principle don't repeat yourself so why
3:31
don't we write this code once and reuse
3:33
it so within the Constructor of the
3:35
parent will accept a name and age
3:40
property we'll assign this.name equals
3:43
name and this. age equals age now we can
3:47
remove that within each of the child
3:48
classes so we don't repeat
3:51
ourselves there's less code to right now
3:54
but we do need to pass in these
3:56
arguments to the parent Constructor name
3:59
and age for
4:05
each and that's all there is to it in
4:08
this example when we construct an object
4:10
either a rabbit a fish or a hawk we'll
4:12
accept three arguments a name age and
4:15
either a run speed a swim speed or a fly
4:18
speed depending on the animal that we're
4:19
creating any properties they assure in
4:22
common we can send to the parent
4:23
Constructor it helps with code
4:25
reusability and there's a lot less to
4:27
write it's not that evident with three
4:29
children classes but imagine if you had
4:31
hundreds of different classes like what
4:33
if this was Pokémon there's like what a
4:35
thousand Pokémon now we would have to
4:37
copy and paste those properties like a
4:39
thousand times for each if we're
4:40
constructing individual Pokémon but
4:43
since all of them share those same
4:44
properties we can write it in one place
4:47
and make any changes only in one place
4:50
so let's test this to see if it works
4:53
let's
4:55
console.log our rabbit's name which is
5:00
named rabbit let's console.log the
5:02
rabbit's age the rabbit is Oney old and
5:06
let's see if the rabbit has a run speed
5:09
25 as in 25 mph let's do this with fish
5:13
fish. name fish. AG let's see if the
5:15
fish has a run
5:17
speed name is fish Age Two run speed is
5:20
undefined because fish can't run because
5:22
they don't have legs but they do have a
5:23
swim speed though swim speed 12 miles
5:27
hour then Hawk hawk. name hawk. AG hawk.
5:32
flyp speed name is Hawk age three the
5:36
hawk has a fly speed of 50
5:38
mph so that's how you can use the super
5:40
keyword in a class to call the
5:42
Constructor of the parent it helps with
5:44
code reusability any properties that the
5:47
children share in common in this case a
5:49
name and Age The Constructor of the
5:51
parent can take care of that we don't
5:53
have to repeat the set of code every
5:55
single time for each child we write it
5:57
in one place and reuse it another
super methods
5:59
another thing you can do too with the
6:00
super keyword is extend a method from
6:02
the parent so what we're going to do
6:04
within the animal parent class is create
6:06
a move
6:08
method within this method we will
6:11
console.log the following
6:13
message the at a placeholder
6:19
this.name moves at a speed of add a
6:25
placeholder speed mph for miles per hour
6:29
hour or if you prefer you can use
6:31
kilometers our move method will have one
6:34
parameter a speed that we need to pass
6:36
in to use So within each of these
6:38
children classes we'll write a method
6:41
that also extends the move method of the
6:44
parent rabbits will have a run
6:48
method we'll output the following
6:51
message
6:53
console.log I'll use a template
6:55
string this add a
6:58
placeholder this.
7:00
name can
7:03
run let's copy our run method paste it
7:06
for fish but change swim to run because
7:09
fish can't run this this. name can
7:14
swim then with Hawks they'll have a fly
7:18
method fly this this. name can
7:24
fly with our rabbit object let's invoke
7:27
the run method
7:31
this rabbit can run let's do this with
7:34
fish fish. swim this fish can swim and
7:39
hawk. fly method this Hawk can fly
7:43
within each of these children classes
7:45
we're going to extend the move method of
7:47
the parent animal within the run method
7:49
of our rabbit class not only are we
7:52
going to Output this
7:53
message we'll also extend the move
7:56
method of the parent and display that
7:58
message as well
7:59
to refer to the parent class we use the
8:01
super keyword it's very similar to this
8:04
but it means the parent use the parents
8:07
move
8:08
method but we do have to send a speed
8:11
argument let's send the Run speed of the
8:14
Rabbit this. Run speed let's do this
8:18
with our fish class we'll extend the
8:20
move method super. move send in this.
8:25
swimp speed and Hawk super. move this do
8:30
fly
8:31
speed now let's take our rabbit use the
8:34
run method and we should extend the move
8:36
method this rabbit can run the rabbit
8:40
moves at a speed of 25
8:42
mph let's do this with fish fish. swim
8:46
the fish can swim the fish moves at a
8:48
speed of 12 mph and hawk hawk. fly
8:53
method this Hawk can fly the hawk moves
8:56
at a speed of 50
8:57
mph so that's how you can use the super
9:00
keyword to extend a method of a parent
conclusion
9:03
all right everybody so that's the super
9:04
keyword it's a reference to a parent it
9:07
can be used to call the Constructor of a
9:09
parent and or access the properties and
9:11
methods of a parent and well everybody
9:14
that is the super keyword in
9:20
JavaScript
