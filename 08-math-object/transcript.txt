Intro

hey what's going on everybody so today
0:01
I'm going to explain math math is a
0:04
built-in JavaScript object that provides
0:06
a collection of math related properties
0:09
and methods for example if you ever need
0:11
the value of pi you would type math with
0:14
a capital M do PI then let's console.log
Pi
0:18
this
0:20
console.log
0:24
math.pi Pi is
0:27
3.14 and the rest of the digits if you
0:30
need e e is known as ul's number it's
0:34
used for the base of natural logarithms
0:36
we won't really be using e in the series
0:38
but if you ever need it it's there math
0:41
does give you access to a lot of useful
0:43
math related methods let's create a few
0:46
variables let X =
0:52
3.21 let y equal to and let Z will be
0:57
undefined if you need to round a number
Round method
1:00
let's say Z equals you can type
1:04
math.round method Place whatever value
1:07
or variable you would like to round
1:08
within the round method let's round X
1:12
store the result within Z then display z
1:17
console.log z so 3.21 rounded is three
1:22
even there's also floor floor will
Floor method
1:25
always round
1:26
down let's change 3.21 to 3. 99 let's
1:31
copy this
1:34
line paste it change round to floor
1:38
floor always rounds down so 3.99 rounded
1:42
down is again three to always round up
Ceiling method
1:45
you can use seal as in seiling the
1:49
opposite of
1:51
floor c e i
1:54
l let's change 3.99 to 3.21 3.21 rounded
1:59
up is four then there's
truncate method
2:06
truncate trunk short for truncate will
2:10
eliminate any decimal portion 3.21
2:13
truncated is three another way to raise
Pow method
2:16
a base to a given power is to use the
2:19
pow method
2:21
P let's raise three to the power of 2 so
2:26
x to the power of Y which would be 9
2:31
y to the^ of X would be
2:35
8 there's a square root
2:38
function
2:40
sqrt let's find the square root of how
2:44
about 81 the square root of 81 is 9 if
2:49
you ever need to find the natural
2:51
logarithm of a number you can use the
2:53
log
2:54
function math. log let's set X to be 10
2:58
the natural logarithm of 10 is 2.3 if
Trig trigonometry
3:02
you need to do anything with
3:03
trigonometry there's s cosine and
3:06
tangent
3:07
functions let's begin with s s n within
3:11
this function you will place radians
3:13
I'll set X to be
Trig sine
3:15
45 so Z is going to be
3:18
0.85 so that's
3:21
s let's do cosine which is
3:25
cosos
3:27
0.52 then tangent
3:33
T and that is
3:35
1.61 let's change X to
3:39
be 3.21
Absolute value
3:41
again to find the absolute value of a
3:44
number you can use the absolute value
3:47
function math.abs
3:50
it's basically going to give you the
3:52
same number but it's going to be
3:54
positive the absolute value of - 3.21 is
3:59
3.2 2 1 basically we're eliminating the
4:01
negative
4:02
sign to find the sign of a number you
4:05
can use the sign function s i g
4:09
n so the sign of - 3.21 is1 If This Were
4:14
a positive number it would be one if
4:17
it's
4:18
zero then the sign is zero here's a
Max and Min
4:22
pretty helpful method we can find the
4:24
maximum or minimum value from a set of
4:27
values or variables let's set Z to be
4:31
1 y will stay as two and X will be
4:35
three I will create a new variable named
4:38
Max it will store the maximum value from
4:41
these three
4:42
variables math.
4:46
Max comma separate each of the variables
4:49
x y z then display the maximum within
4:52
our console. log method the maximum
4:55
value from these three variables is
4:58
three then there's Min for the
5:02
minimum let
5:04
Min do Min so the minimum of these three
5:09
variables is one all right everybody so
5:13
that's math it's a built-in JavaScript
5:15
object that provides a collection of
5:18
properties which was pi and d and
5:21
methods such as round truncate power
5:25
methods related to trigonometry and Max
5:28
and Min methods they're pretty helpful
5:30
if you ever need them and well that is
5:32
what math is in JavaScript
