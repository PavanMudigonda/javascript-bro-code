hey what's going on everybody so in
0:01
today's lesson we're going to create a
0:03
project where we Generate random
0:05
passwords this will help us solidify our
0:07
understanding of functions and random
0:09
numbers this will be an exercise for
0:11
beginners by setting different options
0:14
we can change the format of the password
0:16
and well let's begin everybody all right
0:18
let's begin we'll need to let our
0:20
program know what the length of our
0:21
password is going to be let's create a
0:23
constant to store that const password
0:27
length set this equal to maybe 12 but we
0:31
can adjust that accordingly we'll create
0:33
a Boolean to specify if our generated
0:35
password is going to contain lowercase
0:37
characters we'll create a
0:39
constant include
0:44
lowercase do we want to include
0:46
lowercase characters we can set this to
0:48
be true or false we will set this to be
0:52
true do we want to include uppercase
0:55
characters
0:56
include
0:58
uppercase I will again set this to be
1:01
true do we want to include numbers const
1:05
include
1:07
numbers I will set that to be true do we
1:10
want to include
1:11
symbols const include
1:17
symbols we'll Define a function at the
1:19
top of our
1:21
program function to generate password we
1:26
have a lot of parameters to set up we're
1:29
going to pass all of these constants as
1:32
arguments so we have a
1:35
length include
1:37
lowercase include
1:40
uppercase include
1:43
numbers and include
1:45
symbols when we call this function we
1:48
have to pass in all of these arguments
1:51
so we will call our generate password
1:54
function pass in our password
1:57
length include lowercase
2:00
include
2:02
uppercase include
2:05
numbers and include
2:07
symbols at the bottom of our function we
2:10
will be returning a password but for now
2:13
I'm just going to write an empty string
2:14
because we still need to determine what
2:16
that password is going to be after
2:18
finishing the generate password function
2:20
this will return a string a string
2:22
password we will store that within const
2:26
password equals whatever is returned
2:29
from the generate password function and
2:32
just so that this is more readable
2:34
although not necessary I'm going to
2:36
place each of these arguments on a new
2:37
line because I'm OCD about things being
2:40
in
2:42
alignment and then at the very end of
2:44
this program I will display a template
2:48
string of generated
2:52
password I'll add a placeholder then
2:55
we'll display our password that we
2:58
generate so so right now it's not going
3:01
to display anything we're returning an
3:03
empty string but that is everything we
3:05
need outside of this function to
3:07
generate our password basically we're
3:09
passing in options when we generate our
3:11
password do we want to include lowercase
3:14
characters uppercase characters numbers
3:16
and or symbols we have a
3:18
number and a bunch of Boolean values
3:22
within our password we're going to
3:24
create a few constants within this
3:25
generate password function we will
3:27
create one long string of all of the
3:30
lowercase characters
3:33
chars equals I'm going to go through the
3:36
alphabet we will have one long string of
3:39
alphabetical
3:46
characters and I think I got all of them
3:49
so there should be 26 now we're going to
3:51
do this with uppercase characters const
3:55
uppercase chars
3:58
equals
4:00
I'm going to turn on caps
4:02
lock go through the
4:10
alphabet we'll create a constant of
4:13
number characters number chars
4:18
equals 0 through
4:22
9 and
4:25
symbols const symbol chars
4:31
which symbols would you like to include
4:33
I'll just add a
4:38
bunch that's probably good enough for
4:40
now feel free to add more or
4:43
less we will create a variable for
4:47
allowed chars meaning
4:52
characters and an empty
4:54
password let password equal an empty
4:58
string
5:02
if some of these constants are true we
5:05
would like to take that corresponding
5:07
set of characters and concatenate it to
5:10
the allowed Char string so what we'll do
5:12
is take our allowed characters variable
5:15
you string catenation by using plus
5:18
equals we'll check to see if include
5:21
lowercase is true or false we can use
5:25
the etary operator for that if we would
5:28
like to include lower case characters we
5:31
will string concatenate our lowercase
5:33
chars our lowercase characters otherwise
5:37
we'll concatenate an empty
5:39
string let's do this with uppercase
5:42
characters with our allowed characters
5:45
let's string concatenate and check if
5:47
we're including uppercase characters
5:50
question mark if this is true we will
5:52
concatenate all of the uppercase
5:54
characters we've declared otherwise
5:57
we'll concatenate an empty string so we
6:00
don't include them let's do this with
6:02
number
6:04
chars include numbers are we including
6:07
numbers within our password if so we
6:09
will return our number Char
6:13
string and then
6:16
symbols are we including symbols within
6:19
our password if so concatenate our
6:22
string of symbol characters all right
6:25
just to test everything afterwards I'm
6:28
going to console. log are allowed
6:32
characters so right now I'm going to
6:34
switch all of these constants to be
6:39
false so right now we're not including
6:42
any characters if I were to set include
6:45
a lowercase to be true we would include
6:48
all of the lowercase characters that's
6:50
one long string Let's test uppercase yep
6:54
we are including all of the uppercase
6:56
characters include numbers yes that
6:59
works works and include symbols that
7:02
also works at this point in the program
7:05
we're going to have one gigantic string
7:07
of all of the possible characters before
7:10
we move on with the program I do want to
7:12
run some checks using some if statements
7:15
first let's check to see if the password
7:17
length is zero or less than zero right
7:19
now it's set to
7:20
12 using an if
7:23
statement if the length the length of
7:26
the password is less than or equal to
7:29
zero
7:30
we need to let the user know that the
7:31
password length must be at least one we
7:34
will return a
7:37
string password length must be at least
7:43
one right now we're not generating a
7:45
password we returning an empty string if
7:48
I set the password length to be zero we
7:51
will generate this message password
7:54
length must be at least one or even a
7:56
negative number
7:58
like1 password length must be at least
8:01
one let's set that back to be 12 what if
8:04
we don't select any options what if all
8:07
of these character options were
8:13
false we can check the length of our
8:16
alloud characters variable so
8:19
if our loud characters length
8:23
property is strictly equal to zero this
8:27
will only be possible if all of these
8:29
options are set to false we will return
8:33
a template
8:35
string at at least one set of
8:40
characters needs to be
8:44
selected and let's see if this works yes
8:47
it does at least one set of characters
8:50
needs to be selected I can select any
8:52
options that I would like I will set
8:55
these all to be
8:58
true
9:00
now here's the hard part for as many
9:02
iterations as our password is we will
9:04
select a random character from all of
9:07
the different
9:08
possibilities we will use a for
9:12
Loop we will let I be our index our
9:16
counter we will continue this for loop
9:18
as long as I is less than the length the
9:22
password length then increment I by One
9:25
during each iteration if our password
9:27
length is 12 we will execute this for
9:30
Loop a total of 12 times now we will
9:32
generate a random index const random
9:36
index equals we will use the random
9:40
method of
9:42
math this generates a random number
9:44
between 0 and one I can multiply this
9:47
number that's randomly generated by the
9:49
length of our allowed
9:52
characters let's say we're including
9:54
only lowercase characters well this is a
9:56
total of 26 characters in the alphabet
9:59
but if I'm taking math.random * 26 I'll
10:04
be given a random number between 0 and
10:07
25 but I will need to round it down
10:09
let's enclose this equation with the
10:11
floor method of math to round down math.
10:19
floor we'll use string concatenation
10:21
with our password currently our password
10:23
is an empty string but we will use
10:26
string
10:27
concatenation we will string con anate a
10:30
randomly chosen character from our
10:32
string of allowed characters password
10:35
plus equals are allowed characters at
10:38
the index of random
10:41
index then at the end of this program we
10:44
will return our
10:46
password and let's see if this works
10:50
let's close out of this function we
10:51
don't need it
10:52
anymore and let's see if this works yeah
10:56
there's our password so every time I run
10:58
the program I get a new random password
11:02
and I can turn these options on and off
11:04
let's set all of these options to be
11:05
false to begin
11:09
with and I will set the length to be
11:12
zero let's see what happens password
11:15
length must be at least one all right
11:17
how about a password of 10 10 characters
11:19
long at least one set of characters
11:22
needs to be selected let's select only
11:24
lowercase
11:25
characters yep we only have lowercase
11:28
characters let's allow uppercase
11:30
characters
11:31
now let's allow
11:34
numbers I didn't get any of that time
11:36
let's do it
11:37
again okay there's a number I guess
11:40
numbers don't come up very frequently
11:42
and let's include
11:44
symbols and there's a few symbols in
11:46
there all right everybody so that was an
11:49
exercise to Generate random passwords it
11:52
should give you some practice with
11:53
functions and working with random
11:55
numbers and well everybody that was a
11:57
random password generator
11:59
in
12:03
