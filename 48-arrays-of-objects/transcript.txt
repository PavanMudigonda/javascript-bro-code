array of objects
0:00
hey what's up everybody so in today's
0:02
video I'm going to show you how we can
0:03
work with an array of objects in
0:04
JavaScript what we'll do is create an
0:07
array of fruit objects we'll create five
0:10
fruit objects to create an object you
0:12
need a set of curly braces each object
0:15
will be comma
0:17
separated just for my own readability
0:20
I'm going to place each object on a new
0:23
line objects can have their own unique
0:26
properties and methods our first fruit
0:28
object will have a name name of
0:32
Apple a
0:34
color of red and calories meaning
0:39
calories per serving of
0:42
95 this is our first object let's copy
0:46
these properties paste them for object
0:47
two change name to be orange color will
0:51
also be
0:54
orange calories
0:56
45 object three name will be banana
1:00
color yellow calories
1:05
105 object
1:07
4 coconut color white calories
1:13
159 then our last object will be
1:18
pineapple color yellow calories
1:23
37 all right and here is our array of
1:26
objects there's a lot we can do with
1:28
this if you ever need a property within
access object properties
1:30
one of these objects of your array you
1:32
would take the array in this case fruits
1:35
add an index number dot the name of the
1:38
property for example name I need the
1:41
name property of the first object which
1:44
would be Apple so let's test that
1:48
console.log what is the name property of
1:52
our array fruits at index zero that
1:54
would be apple one is orange two is
1:58
banana three is is coconut for pineapple
2:03
let's select a different property let's
2:05
go with the
2:07
calories
2:09
95
2:11
45 105
2:14
159 37 that's how to access a property
2:18
within an array of objects to add a new
push()
2:20
object you can use the push method let's
2:23
take our array of fruits use the push
2:26
method we will push a new object into
2:29
our array
2:31
the name will be
2:34
grapes
2:36
Color
2:39
Purple
2:40
calories
2:43
62 then let's console.log
2:48
rray console.log fruits so we have six
2:53
Apple orange banana coconut pineapple
2:55
and grapes uh which I misspelled
2:58
grap you can use the pop method to
pop()
3:01
remove an
3:02
element fruits. pop this should remove
3:08
pineapple Apple orange banana coconut no
splice()
3:11
pineapple or splice splice will remove
3:14
elements at certain indices fruits.
3:20
splice let's select indices 1 through
3:23
two all we're left with is Apple coconut
3:27
pineapple you can use the four method to
forEach()
3:30
Loop through the elements of your array
3:32
let's display each object's name
3:35
fruits. for each we need a call back a
3:39
function expression or an arrow function
3:42
let's use an arrow function for every
3:44
fruit do this
3:47
console.log each fruit this will return
3:51
entire
3:52
objects for one of the properties we'll
3:55
select dot the property name we have
3:59
have all the fruit
4:01
names let's go with the
4:03
colors and the
4:06
calories there we
map()
4:08
are there's also the map method the map
4:11
method will run each element through a
4:13
function and return a new array let's
4:15
create an array of fruit names const
4:18
fruit names equals take our array of
4:21
fruits use the built-in map method we'll
4:25
use an arrow function for every
4:28
fruit Arrow
4:30
return the fruits
4:32
name then we will
4:37
console.log our array of fruit
4:40
names and here's our array of fruit
4:43
names let's do this with
4:45
colors fruit
4:49
colors return every color property of
4:53
each
4:53
fruit then console.log are fruit
4:58
colors red orange yellow white yellow
5:01
let's do this with
5:03
calories fruit
5:06
calories return each calories
5:10
property
5:11
console.log our fruit calories
5:14
array so the map method will return a
5:17
new array let's cover filter filter will
filter()
5:21
return a new array after using each
5:23
element and checking a condition let's
5:26
return a new array where the color of
5:28
each fruit is yellow there's two const
5:32
yellow
5:33
fruits equals take our array of
5:37
fruits use the filter method we have one
5:40
parameter a fruit Arrow then a condition
5:45
we'll return this fruit if the fruit's
5:48
color property is strictly equal to
5:54
Yellow then
5:56
console.log array of yellow fruit
6:00
and there's two bananas and pineapples
6:03
their colors are both yellow let's
6:06
create a new array of any fruits that
6:08
are low in calories where the calories
6:10
are below
6:12
100 const low cal fruits take our array
6:17
of fruits use the built-in filter method
6:20
for every
6:22
fruit Arrow check the calories of each
6:26
fruit is it less than 100 if it is put
6:30
it within this new
6:31
array and here we are we have three
6:34
fruits that are low in
6:35
calories Apple orange pineapple the
6:39
calories are 95 45 37 they're all less
6:42
than
6:44
100 let's find any high calorie
6:48
fruits change our Ray to be high Cal
6:52
fruits where the calories of each fruit
6:54
is greater than or equal to 100
6:57
console.log Ray of High Cal fruits there
7:01
are
7:02
two bananas and coconuts the calories
7:05
are 105 and
7:08
159 let's use the reduce method now I'll
reduce()
7:11
admit this is going to be a little
7:12
tricky but I'll try my best to walk you
7:14
through it the reduceed method will
7:16
return a single value in this case an
7:19
object one of these objects let's return
7:22
the object with the greatest amount of
7:25
calories we'll store that within a
7:27
constant const Max X
7:30
fruit equals take our array of fruits
7:34
use the reduce method there's going to
7:37
be two
7:38
parameters an
7:41
accumulator which keeps track of the
7:43
greatest value during each iteration and
7:45
the next element but I think we should
7:48
rename these let's rename our
7:50
accumulator as Max it's going to be the
7:54
current record holder of the object with
7:56
the greatest amount of calories element
7:59
will be fruit meaning the next fruit
8:02
here are the two
8:03
parameters Arrow what are we going to
8:06
check is our fruit the next fruit in
8:10
line are the calories
8:13
greater than our current record holders
8:16
calories max.
8:19
calories just for readability I'm going
8:21
to put this on a new
8:24
line we're going to use the trary
8:26
operator is this true does the next
8:29
fruit have more calories than our record
8:31
holder if it does will return our fruit
8:36
meaning the next fruit colon meaning
8:39
otherwise return the max again let's see
8:42
if this works let's
8:45
console. log our fruit with the maximum
8:48
amount of calories which is our coconut
8:52
with 159 calories if you just need the
8:55
calories you would type dot calories
8:59
that will just give you the calories but
9:01
in this case we're returning an entire
9:03
object let's find the fruit with the
9:06
least amount of calories let's copy our
9:09
code paste
9:12
it and make a few
9:15
changes Min
9:17
fruit change Max to be
9:22
Min the condition will be is the
9:25
calories of the next fruit less than the
9:28
Cal iies of the minimum record
9:32
holder then console.log are Min fruit
9:36
which is our pineapple with 37
9:40
calories all right everybody so those
9:42
are a few ways in which you can work
9:43
with an array of objects there's a lot
9:45
you can do with them you can map you can
9:47
filter you can reduce you can splice you
9:50
can pop you can push all sorts of things
9:52
and well that is an example of an array
9:54
of objects in
9:58
JavaScript
