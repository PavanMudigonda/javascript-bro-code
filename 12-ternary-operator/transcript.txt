intro
0:00
hey uh welcome back so today I'm going
0:02
to explain the Trenary operator in
0:04
JavaScript you write a condition then
0:07
add a little question mark kind of like
0:09
you're asking a question how is this
0:10
useful well it's a shortcut to if and
0:14
else statements it helps to assign a
0:16
variable based on a condition you write
0:19
a condition then use the ternary
0:21
operator as if you're asking a question
0:23
you can write some code if that
0:25
condition is true what would you like to
0:27
do then add a colon then some code if
0:31
that condition is false here's an
example 1
0:33
example let's say we have a user's age
0:36
age equals 21. I would like to check to
0:40
see if somebody's age is greater than or
0:42
equal to 18. age greater than equal to
0:47
18 then I will use the ternary operator
0:50
kind of like I'm asking a question
0:52
is age greater than or equal to 18 if
0:56
this condition is true we can write some
0:59
code I'll create a string
1:01
you're an adult
1:05
then what if the condition is false I'll
1:07
add a colon
1:09
then I will execute this code if the
1:11
condition is false
1:13
you're a minor
1:18
this is helpful if you need to assign a
1:20
variable based on a condition
1:23
so I'll create a new variable let
1:26
message equals
1:29
then we write our condition
1:31
so if age is greater than or equal to 18
1:35
if that's true we will assign this
1:37
string to this variable this message if
1:40
it's false instead we will assign this
1:43
one it's an alternative to writing
1:45
something like this
1:57
so with programming we try not to repeat
1:59
ourselves if we don't have to
2:01
here we're assigning message to be
2:04
either this string or this one
2:07
our ternary operator is more condensed
2:09
and I feel like it's easier to read than
2:11
that if else statement
2:14
it's a shortcut if you choose to use it
2:16
I tend to use it a lot then just to test
2:19
it let's console.log our message just to
2:22
be sure that it works fine
2:24
console.log our message
2:27
our age is 21 you're an adult if my age
2:30
was 12.
2:31
you'll remind her let's go over a few
2:34
more exercises
example 2
2:37
this time we will have let time time
2:40
will be between 1 and 24 like a 24 hour
2:43
clock I will set time to be 16.
2:48
16 I think would be 4 P.M
2:51
we will assign a greeting
2:54
equals then we'll write a condition is
2:58
time less than 12.
3:00
the enternary operator like we're asking
3:03
a question
3:04
if the time is less than 12 it's the
3:06
morning good morning
3:10
we'll use a colon then write some code
3:12
if it's false
3:14
if it's not the morning it's at least
3:16
the afternoon good afternoon
3:20
then let's console.log
3:22
our greeting
3:26
good afternoon because it's 4 P.M what
3:29
if it was 9. good morning
3:31
all right I have a few more examples
3:35
foreign
example 3
3:39
student this will be true or false if
3:43
you're a student
3:45
let message equals
3:49
now with the Boolean variable you can
3:51
just write the Boolean variable itself
3:54
is student question mark are you a
3:57
student if so
3:59
you are a student
4:02
if not
4:04
you are not a student
4:10
then let's console.log
4:14
our message
4:17
we are a student you are a student let's
4:19
set this to be false you are not a
4:22
student
4:23
it's very easy to read with Boolean
4:25
variables you write the Boolean variable
4:28
then add a question mark
example 4
4:30
here's a challenge round
4:32
we will have a purchase amount as if
4:35
somebody's buying something if
4:37
somebody's purchase amount is over one
4:39
hundred dollars they get a 10 discount
4:42
so let
4:44
purchase amount equal let's say 125
4:49
dollars or some other unit of currency
4:51
of your choosing
4:53
let
4:55
discount
4:57
equals
4:59
then the condition is
5:01
we're checking if purchase amount is
5:03
greater than or equal to 100 100
5:07
question mark
5:10
is somebody's purchase amount greater
5:11
than one hundred dollars
5:14
if so they will get a 10 discount
5:18
colon
5:20
if that's false they get no discount
5:22
zero
5:25
so then let's display the total
5:27
console.log
5:30
I'll use a template literal
5:33
your total is I need a dollar sign for
5:37
our unit of currency then I need a
5:39
placeholder so I need another dollar
5:40
sign
5:42
the purchase amount
5:46
minus
5:49
the purchase amount
5:51
multiplied by let me scoot over a little
5:56
the discount
5:59
divided by 100
6:03
so the total since we get a discount
6:06
is one hundred twelve dollars and fifty
6:09
cents if our purchase amount was ninety
6:12
nine dollars well we don't get that
6:14
discount your total is 99.
6:17
all right everybody so that's the
6:18
Trenary operator it's a shortcut to an
6:21
if else statement it helps to assign a
6:23
variable based on a condition you write
6:25
a condition add a question mark as if
6:28
you're asking a question do this code if
6:30
that condition is true else do this code
6:33
if that condition is false I'll be using
6:36
the ternary operator a lot just because
6:38
I feel like it's helpful and well that
6:40
is the ternary operator in JavaScript
