introduction

hey it's me again so today I got to
0:02
explain element selectors in JavaScript
0:05
element selectors are methods used to
0:08
Target and manipulate HTML Elements by
0:11
using these methods they allow you to
0:13
select one or more multiple HTML
0:15
elements from the Dom the document
0:17
object model these methods are built-in
0:20
methods of document the Dom we can
0:23
select Elements by an ID a Class A tag
0:26
name and then there's query selector and
0:28
query selector all these methods return
0:31
something different either an element an
0:33
HTML collection or a node list one
getElementById()
0:36
method you're probably already familiar
0:38
with is get element by ID so in this
0:41
example within our HTML document we will
0:43
create an H1 element I will create a
0:46
heading for my sample web page I'm
0:49
hungry so I'm going to talk about food
0:51
my heading is going to be food are us
0:55
it's like Toys R Us but it's with food
0:58
I'm going to give this H1 element an ID
1:01
of my Dash
1:05
heading so going back to our JavaScript
1:07
file I can select this element by its ID
1:11
I'll store a reference to it const my
1:15
heading equals we're accessing the Dom
1:18
with
1:19
document. get element by ID that ID was
1:25
my heading I can access this element
1:28
this H1 element using this reference so
1:32
let's take my
1:34
heading access its
1:36
style access its background
1:41
color so with CSS properties in
1:43
JavaScript if you're accessing them
1:45
through the Dom they have a camel case
1:47
naming convention if you're selecting
1:49
these properties with
1:51
CSS they have a hyphenated naming
1:53
convention so do pay attention to that
1:56
so with the background color I will set
1:59
it to be yellow as if we're highlighting
2:01
it you could also apply different CSS
2:04
properties let's take my heading access
2:08
its style access the text align property
2:13
and set it to be
2:15
Center and it's now centered now if I
2:18
was to
2:20
console.log this element of my heading
2:23
this is what we would
2:27
see it displays my h HTML element
2:31
including its style if it has style for
2:34
some reason if this ID doesn't exist for
2:37
example I'll misspell heading as heading
2:39
with an extra G well this returns null
2:44
if I were to eliminate these two lines
2:45
of code you can see that null get
2:49
element by ID returns a single element
2:52
if it finds it or null if it doesn't the
getElementsClassName()
2:56
next method is get Elements by class
2:58
name this returns an HTML collection
3:01
it's similar to an array but it's
3:03
limited in the built-in methods that it
3:04
has So within our HTML document I will
3:08
create three separate div
3:10
sections this first div element will
3:13
have a class of
3:15
fruits my first fruit will be Apple so
3:19
let's copy this development paste it two
3:21
times I'll change the second to be
3:24
orange then
3:27
banana all right going back to our
3:29
Javascript file I will use this method
3:32
of get Elements by class name this will
3:35
return an HTML collection it's similar
3:38
to an array but it's not technically the
3:40
same so const fruits this will be the
3:44
name of my HTML collection equals
3:48
document we're accessing the Dom get
3:52
Elements by class
3:55
name what is the class name that we're
3:57
getting fruits
4:03
let's
4:04
console.log fruits just to see what it
4:06
is what are we working
4:11
with so fruits is an HTML collection my
4:15
collection contains these three elements
4:18
we have three objects within this HTML
4:20
collection if I was to take a look at
4:22
some of these properties we should have
4:25
text content so for the first element we
4:27
have text content of Apple
4:30
for the next Dev elopment which has an
4:32
index of one the text content is orange
4:36
we can assume that the next element has
4:38
text content of banana to change
4:40
something about one of these elements
4:42
let's begin with the first element we
4:44
have an HTML collection of fruits to
4:47
select one of these elements you'll use
4:49
an index so let's take our HTML
4:52
collection of fruits at index zero
4:55
that's going to return the first element
4:57
our div element of Apple I will access
5:00
its style access its background
5:04
color set it equal to be yellow as if
5:07
we're highlighting
5:08
it there we are Apple it's highlighted
5:11
for the next element I will increase the
5:13
index to one that will select our orange
5:16
and then two would be banana if I would
5:20
like to iterate over all of these
5:21
elements I can use an enhanced for
5:25
Loop we'll say let fruit of
5:30
fruits HTML collections are iterable we
5:34
can iterate them with an enhanced for
5:36
Loop let's take each fruit access its
5:40
style access its background
5:44
color then set it to be
5:47
yellow and that should highlight all of
5:49
them now HTML collections don't have a
5:53
builtin for each method HTML collections
5:56
do allow for live updates but
5:58
unfortunately they have a limited amount
6:00
of utility
6:01
methods if I attempt to use our HTML
6:04
collection of fruits then attempt to use
6:07
a for each
6:09
method here's what
6:11
happens we have a type error fruits. 4
6:15
each is not a function HTML collections
6:19
don't have a for each method we're not
6:21
able to use that what we could do is typ
6:25
cast our HTML collection as an array
6:28
let's access the class of array then use
6:31
the from
6:34
method this will return a new array of
6:36
fruits we'll typ cast our HTML
6:39
collection as an array then you could
6:42
follow this with the for each method if
6:44
you so choose for each element within
6:46
our array after typc casting it let's
6:49
take each fruit I'll use an arrow
6:52
function what would we like to do let's
6:55
take each fruit access its style add
6:59
access its background
7:02
color then set it to be yellow as if
7:04
we're highlighting
7:06
it and that does work get Elements by
7:10
class name will return an HTML
7:12
collection of all matching elements that
7:15
share this class if you would like to
7:17
use array methods with this HTML
7:19
collection you would want to typ cast it
7:21
to an array all right now we have get
getElementsByTagName()
7:24
Elements by tag name within our HTML
7:27
document we'll create create two
7:29
unordered lists I will create an H4
7:33
heading of
7:35
root
7:38
vegetables let me scroll
7:40
down I will create an unordered
7:43
list with a few list items three should
7:45
be good for my first list item that will
7:49
be beets beets are a root
7:53
vegetable
7:57
carrots and potatoes
8:01
let's copy our unordered list and our H4
8:03
heading paste it change the second H4
8:07
heading to be nonroot
8:10
vegetables my first list item within
8:12
this other list will be
8:16
broccoli
8:20
celery and onions I just picked three
8:24
vegetables kind of at
8:25
random with our next method of get
8:27
Elements by tag name I can select one of
8:30
these elements by their tag name H4
8:33
unordered list list items take all
8:36
matches within our HTML document stick
8:39
them all within an HTML collection I
8:42
will create const const H4 elements
8:48
equals we're accessing the Dom use the
8:51
get Elements by tag name
8:55
method let's select all H4 elements
9:00
then I will
9:02
console.log my HTML collection of H4
9:06
elements let's see what it
9:09
is so it looks like this HTML collection
9:11
has two
9:12
elements two H4 elements the text
9:16
content of the first element is root
9:18
vegetables then we can assume that the
9:20
other element is non-root vegetables yes
9:23
it is non-root
9:26
vegetables we can access individual ele
9:29
elements of this HTML collection by an
9:31
index let's take this reference of H4
9:34
elements access the first
9:37
index access the style access the
9:40
background
9:42
color set it to be yellow as if we're
9:44
highlighting it and that should
9:46
highlight root vegetables the next index
9:50
of one would be non-root vegetables to
9:53
apply CSS properties to all of the
9:55
elements I can use an enhanced for Loop
9:59
for let H4 element singular of H4
10:06
elements plural take each H4 element
10:10
access its style access its background
10:13
color set it to be
10:15
yellow and that will highlight all of
10:17
the H4
10:19
elements let's create another HTML
10:21
collection of all the list item elements
10:23
we'll create another reference to all
10:25
list item elements so that'll be Beats
10:29
carrots potatoes broccoli celery and
10:31
onions const Li elements equals
10:37
document. getet Elements by tag
10:42
name the tag that we're selecting is all
10:45
list item
10:47
elements so using a for Loop let's
10:49
iterate through
10:51
them let Li I element singular of Li I
10:57
elements plural for each list item
11:01
element access the style access the
11:04
background color then set it to be a
11:07
different color let's say light
11:11
green and now all list item elements
11:14
will be a light green color and again
11:17
since these are HTML collections not
11:19
arrays they don't have any array methods
11:22
but we can typ cast them so that they do
11:25
if I wanted to change the background
11:26
color of these with the for each method
11:28
of
11:29
arays I'm going to typ cast our HTML
11:32
collection of H4 elements as an
11:34
array I will access the class of array
11:38
use the from
11:40
method pass our HTML collection of H4
11:43
elements as an argument if I wanted to
11:45
use the for each loop I can method chain
11:48
follow this with for
11:50
each what do we want to do for each of
11:52
these elements take each H4 element use
11:56
an arrow function do this
11:59
take each H4 element access its style
12:03
access its background color set it to be
12:08
yellow and that does work so let's do
12:12
this with our list item elements I'll
12:14
just copy this because I'm lazy we'll
12:16
typ cast our list item elements HTML
12:19
collection for each list item element
12:23
take each list item element access its
12:26
style access its background color set it
12:29
to be light green and that does work too
12:34
that is the get Elements by tag name
12:36
selector it will select all elements
12:39
with a matching tag name throughout your
12:40
document it returns an HTML
12:43
collection now we're going to talk about
querySelector()
12:45
query selector query selector will
12:48
return the first matching element or
12:51
null if it doesn't find any matches I
12:53
will create a const of element equals
12:58
document
12:59
do query
13:02
selector query selector will return the
13:04
first match to select an element by a
13:07
class name we'll use dot the name of the
13:10
class these three elements have a class
13:13
of fruits let's select that dot fruits
13:18
if I was to take this element access its
13:21
style access its background color set it
13:25
to be yellow which element do you think
13:27
is going to be selected
13:29
the first Apple it's the first matching
13:32
element Corey selector only returns a
13:35
single element the first match if I
13:38
selected a tag name of H4 that would
13:42
select root vegetables even though we
13:44
have two H4 elements the first match is
13:47
selected if I selected the first list
13:50
item element that would select beats
13:54
that is the first list item element on
13:56
my web page if I change this to UL
13:59
meaning unordered list it would select
14:01
the first unordered list if I attempt to
14:05
select something that doesn't exist like
14:07
any ordered
14:09
lists well they don't exist there's no
14:11
matches if I was to
14:15
console.log my
14:19
element it would return null there's no
14:22
matches so query selector selects the
14:25
first matching element or null you can
14:29
select a class or a tag
14:32
name then the last method we'll discuss
querySelectorAll()
14:35
is query selector all this returns a
14:37
node list a node list is similar to an
14:41
HTML collection except it has built-in
14:44
methods similar to arrays however node
14:47
lists are static HTML collections are
14:50
live since node lists are static they do
14:53
not update automatically in the Dom HTML
14:56
collections are live they will I'm going
14:59
to select all elements that have a class
15:01
of fruits I'll create a reference to
15:04
this const fruits
15:07
equals
15:09
document. query selector
15:13
all we are getting a class of
15:18
fruits I can access this node list by an
15:20
index number let's select the first
15:23
element access the style access the
15:26
background color set it to be
15:32
yellow and that will select Apple let's
15:35
select to the next element that's orange
15:39
the next would be
15:42
banana let's select all list item
15:45
elements I'm going to rename this though
15:47
let's rename fruits as
15:50
Foods let's select the first element
15:53
that would be
15:54
beets the next element would be carrots
15:57
then potatoes
16:00
broccoli
16:01
celery
16:03
onions so if I was to
16:07
console.log
16:11
Foods this would give me a node list
16:14
with six
16:15
elements node lists do have a built-in
16:17
for each method let's use that we don't
16:20
need to typ cast it as an
16:22
array take our node list of foods use
16:25
the built-in for each method what do we
16:28
want to do take each food use an arrow
16:32
function do this take each food access
16:36
its style access its background color
16:39
set it to be
16:42
yellow this will take all list item
16:45
elements change the background color to
16:47
Yellow as if we're highlighting them all
conclusion
16:50
right everybody so those are different
16:51
element selectors get element by ID get
16:54
Elements by class name get Elements by
16:56
tag name query selector and query res
16:58
select or all there is a lot of overlap
17:01
where you could select any number of
17:02
these to select something but they each
17:04
return something different personally I
17:06
like using a combination of get element
17:09
by ID and query selector all but that's
17:12
just my personal preference in
17:14
conclusion element selectors are methods
17:17
used to Target and manipulate HTML
17:19
elements they allow you to select one or
17:22
more multiple HTML elements from the Dom
17:24
once you select your element or elements
17:27
you can make any sort of changes that
17:28
you would like and well everybody those
17:30
are element selectors in
17:36
JavaScript
