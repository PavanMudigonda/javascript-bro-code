introduction

hey welcome back everybody so today I
0:02
got to explain callbacks in JavaScript a
0:05
callback is a function that is passed as
0:07
an argument to another function they are
0:09
used to handle asynchronous operations
0:12
such as reading a file Network requests
0:15
or interacting with databases these
0:17
activities take some time to complete
0:19
now with JavaScript we don't necessarily
0:21
wait for a process to finish before
0:23
continuing with the rest of the program
0:25
for example if we were to read a file if
0:27
it takes a long time to read that file
0:30
JavaScript might continue on with the
0:31
rest of the program we might attempt to
0:33
display the contents of that file before
0:35
we're finished reading it that's where
0:36
callbacks come in we're telling
0:38
JavaScript hey when you're done call
0:41
this next when you're done reading the
0:43
file then display the contents only
0:46
after that process is complete I'll give
0:48
you a few examples of the syntax of a
example 1
0:50
call back we'll start with something
0:52
really simple we'll create a function to
0:54
display the word hello this will be the
0:57
hello
0:58
function then I will
1:01
console.log the
1:03
word
1:05
hello so I can invoke this function
1:08
hello to execute
1:11
it hello what if we were to create a
1:15
function for goodbye
1:18
function goodbye we will
1:22
console.log
1:24
goodbye okay after hello let's invoke
1:27
goodbye we have hello then goodbye what
1:31
if my hello function takes a lot of time
1:33
to process well JavaScript isn't
1:36
necessarily going to wait around before
1:38
executing the goodbye function I'm going
1:40
to add a few lines of code you don't
1:42
need to copy this these few lines of
1:44
code are going to make us wait for 3
1:46
seconds you don't need to write this
1:48
down but do pay attention we will
1:51
execute the hello function followed by
1:52
the goodbye function but we're going to
1:54
pretend that our hello function takes a
1:56
little bit of time to
1:58
process so so now we have goodbye
2:00
already executed followed by hello but
2:03
it should be the other way around I
2:05
would like to guarantee that the goodby
2:08
function follows after the hello
2:10
function well I can do that by adding a
2:13
call back to the goodbye function after
2:15
the hello function is complete we'll get
2:17
rid of this goodbye function
2:19
invocation to use a call back you pass a
2:22
function as an argument to another
2:24
function we will pass the goodbye
2:27
function as an argument to the hello
2:29
function
2:31
So within the set of parentheses type
2:32
the name of the function goodbye now be
2:35
sure you don't add a set of parentheses
2:36
after the function name you'll call it
2:38
right away we are passing the name of
2:40
the function as an argument but we need
2:43
a matching parameter I will name this
2:45
parameter
2:47
callback after everything within this
2:49
function is
2:50
complete let's take our callback then
2:53
invoke it by adding a set of parentheses
2:56
invoke meaning call all right now let's
2:59
see what happens
3:01
we have our hello function followed by
3:04
the goodbye function in that order let's
3:06
create another
3:07
function what about a leave function
3:10
we'll tell somebody to
3:12
leave
3:15
console.log leave I will pass the name
3:18
of this function as an argument to the
3:20
hello function leave is now our call
3:23
back after executing the hello function
3:26
we will execute our call back and in
3:28
this case it's the leave function let's
3:31
create another function for weight
3:33
function
3:36
weight console.
3:38
log wait we'll pass the name of the
3:41
function as an argument to the hello
3:43
function weight is now our call back we
3:46
will execute the hello function followed
3:48
by the weight function so by using
3:51
callbacks we are guaranteeing that the
3:53
function passed in will execute next you
3:56
can pass callbacks as well as other
3:58
arguments to a function
example 2
4:00
let's go over a second example I will
4:03
create a function to sum two numbers
4:06
together X comma y I'll also add a call
4:11
back callback X comma y we have three
4:14
parameters total within the sum function
4:17
we will create a local variable of
4:20
result add x +
4:23
y and then I will call my call back then
4:27
I'll pass the result as an argument to
4:29
the callback function then I will create
4:32
a function to display the result to my
4:35
console display console there is one
4:39
parameter we have a result argument
4:41
we're
4:42
receiving then
4:45
console.log my
4:47
result all right now we will invoke the
4:50
sum function but we have three arguments
4:53
that we need to pass in a call back a
4:57
value for x and a value for y let's
4:59
invoke the display console function as a
5:01
call back again be sure to not add a set
5:04
of parenthesis after the name because
5:05
then you'll invoke it right
5:06
away X will be 1 y will be two and let's
5:11
see the result the result is three So
5:15
within our sum function calculate the
5:17
result first then after that process is
5:20
finished then display the result to the
5:22
console let's create a separate function
5:25
to display the result to our document
5:27
object window our web page basically
5:30
uh let's pretend that this wasn't
5:32
here I'll create an H1 element with an
5:36
ID of my
5:41
H1 I will create a separate
5:44
function
5:46
display page to display on the web page
5:50
I think display Dom would be more
5:52
appropriate but I haven't explained with
5:53
the document object model is yet so
5:56
let's just work with display page
6:00
we will accept a result I will change
6:03
the text content of the my H1
6:05
element document. getet element by ID
6:11
the ID was my H1 we will change the text
6:17
content to equal our result that we
6:20
receive as a callback we will use the
6:23
display page function display
6:26
page there and the result is three after
6:30
this calculation processes execute the
6:32
call back and this time we are passing
6:34
it to the display page function that we
6:36
created all right everybody so that's a
6:38
call back it's a function that is passed
6:40
as an argument to another function
6:42
they're used to handle asynchronous
6:44
operations operations that may take a
6:47
variable amount of time such as reading
6:49
a file Network requests or interacting
6:51
with databases we're not exactly sure
6:53
when these processes are going to
6:55
complete by using a callback we can
6:57
ensure that a function executes after
6:59
these processes are complete and not
7:01
before accidentally all we're doing is
7:03
saying hey when you're done call this
7:06
next we'll have more practice with
7:08
callbacks especially in the upcoming
7:10
topics and well everybody those are
7:12
callbacks in
7:15
JavaScript
