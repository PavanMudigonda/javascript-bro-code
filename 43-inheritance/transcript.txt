hey what's up everybody so in today's
0:02
video I got to explain inheritance
0:04
inheritance allows a new class to
0:06
inherit properties and methods from an
0:08
existing class these two classes have a
0:11
parent child relationship a child will
0:13
inherit properties and methods from a
0:15
parent it's kind of like a family tree a
0:18
child will inherit genes from a parent
0:20
inheritance helps with code reusability
0:22
because we don't need to keep on
0:24
repeating the same properties and
0:25
methods if all the children share them
0:27
here's an example we'll create an animal
0:29
class
0:31
class animal will have a property of
0:35
alive if you're an animal you start off
0:37
being alive all animals should be able
0:40
to eat and sleep we'll create methods
0:42
for
0:43
those we'll have an eat method all we're
0:46
going to do is
0:48
console.log I'll use a template
0:51
string this now I'll add a
0:55
placeholder
0:58
this.name is
1:01
eating and a Sleep
1:05
Method
1:07
sleep this this. name is
1:12
sleeping animal will be the parent class
1:15
we'll create children classes that
1:16
inherit these properties and methods
1:19
let's create a few children classes
1:21
class rabbit our rabbit class will
1:25
inherit all the properties and methods
1:26
of the animal class to declare a parent
1:29
child relationship ship the child will
1:32
extends the parent
1:35
animal for the rabbit I'm going to give
1:38
this class a name name equals rabbit
1:42
this will be a property if you're
1:44
familiar with the static keyword you can
1:46
make the static now we'll create a fish
1:49
class that also extends animal class
1:53
fish extends
1:56
animal fish will have one property name
2:00
equals
2:01
fish and a hawk class class Hawk
2:07
extends
2:09
animal will have one name
2:13
property
2:15
Hawk all right let's see if this works
2:17
if we create a rabbit fish and Hawk
2:19
object they should have access to these
2:21
properties and
2:25
methods let's create const rabbit equals
2:29
new
2:32
rabbit
2:33
const fish equals new
2:40
Fish const Hawk equals New
2:45
Hawk all right let's see if our rabbit
2:48
has an A Life
2:50
Property
2:53
console.log take the name of the object
2:56
rabbit do access a property or method
2:59
aot Al that's our property the rabbit is
3:02
alive but what if the hawk swoops in and
3:05
kills the rabbit let's change the alive
3:08
property of the
3:09
rabbit rabbit. alive equals false the
3:13
rabbit is no longer
3:15
alive now let's see if our rabbit has
3:18
access to a eat and Sleep
3:22
Method rabbit.
3:26
eat this rabbit is eating and sleep
3:30
rabbit.
3:33
sleep the rabbit is sleeping Let's test
3:36
this with
3:37
fish fish. alive fish. eat method fish.
3:41
Sleep
3:42
Method the fish is alive the fish is
3:44
eating the fish is
3:46
sleeping and Hawk hawk. alive hawk. eat
3:50
method hawk. Sleep Method the hawk Is
3:54
Alive the hawk is eating the hawk is
3:56
sleeping our children classes of rabbit
3:59
fish and ha all inherited the properties
4:01
and methods of the parent animal class
4:04
this helps with code reusability because
4:06
I don't need to declare all of these
4:08
properties and methods within each of
4:10
the children classes like
4:14
this we're saving a lot of lines of code
4:17
it's not that apparent with just a few
4:19
child classes but imagine if you had
4:21
hundreds of different child classes well
4:23
by using inheritance you would be saving
4:25
a lot of time but not only that the
4:28
children can have their own unique
4:29
properties and methods too for example
4:32
rabbits will be able to run but fish and
4:35
Hawks can't run that's a method that
4:38
only belongs to rabbits within our
4:40
rabbit class let's create a new method a
4:42
run
4:45
method will
4:48
console.log I'll use a template
4:50
string
4:52
this add a
4:54
placeholder
4:56
this.name is
4:58
running
5:00
within our fish class let's create a
5:02
swim
5:04
method
5:05
swim this this do name is
5:10
swimming and Hawks will be able to
5:14
fly we'll create a fly method this this.
5:18
name is
5:20
flying let's minimize these
5:24
classes let's take our rabbit object
5:27
display the alive property the eat
5:30
method the Sleep Method and the run
5:32
method rabbit. run method the rabbit is
5:36
eating the rabbit is sleeping the rabbit
5:38
is running now let's do this with fish
5:41
fish. alive fish. eat method fish. Sleep
5:45
Method now does the fish have a run
5:47
method it does not fish. run is not a
5:51
function run is a method that belongs to
5:54
the rabbit class fish can't run because
5:56
well they don't have legs we did not
5:58
give our fish class a run method they
6:00
can swim though but they can't run fish.
6:04
swim
6:05
method the fish is swimming let's do
6:08
this with
6:12
Hawk our Hawk cannot swim but it can fly
6:16
we'll use the fly
6:18
method the hawk is eating the hawk is
6:20
sleeping the hawk is flying and of
6:22
course our rabbit can't fly or
6:26
Swim does our rabbit have a fly method
6:29
it does not rabbit. fly is not a
6:31
function all right everybody so that's
6:33
inheritance it allows a new class to
6:36
inherit properties and methods from an
6:38
existing Class A Child inherits
6:40
properties and methods from a parent it
6:42
helps with code reusability I don't need
6:45
to declare all of these properties and
6:46
methods for each of these classes I can
6:48
simply reuse it that helps us follow the
6:51
dry principle don't repeat
6:53
yourself and well everybody that is an
6:56
introduction to inheritance in
6:58
