example 1
0:00
hey hey hey what's going on everybody
0:01
today I'm going to explain rest
0:02
parameters in JavaScript rest parameters
0:05
is a parameter prefixed with three dots
0:08
they allow a function to work with a
0:10
variable number of arguments by bundling
0:13
them into an array it's very similar to
0:16
the spread operator which we talked
0:17
about in the last video the spread
0:19
operator expands an array into separate
0:21
elements rest parameters do the opposite
0:24
they bundle separate elements into an
0:26
array spread will spread an array into
0:28
separate elements rest parameters will
0:30
bundle separate elements into an array
0:32
it effectively does the opposite how
0:34
could rest parameters be useful let me
0:36
give you an example say we have a bunch
0:38
of different
0:40
food const food one food one equals
0:44
Pizza we'll create a few different food
0:48
variables let's start with four food one
0:51
food two food three food four we have
0:54
pizza
0:57
hamburger hot dog and sushi
1:00
I'm going to create a function that uses
1:02
rest parameters it's going to Output all
1:04
food that I send
1:06
it we'll pretend that we're opening a
1:09
fridge imagine that all of this food is
1:11
in a fridge open fridge fridge short for
1:16
refrigerator to use rest parameters I
1:18
need three dots we're going to stick all
1:20
of this food into an array but what
1:22
should the array name be let's say Foods
1:25
that's descriptive then I'm going to
1:28
console.log
1:30
my array of
1:32
foods now I'm going to call this
1:34
function open fridge I will send this
1:38
function a variable number of arguments
1:41
this method is going to display an
1:43
array we have food one
1:46
pizza food 2 hamburger hamburger is also
1:51
within our array food three hot dog food
1:55
for sushi let me add one more food let's
1:59
add Ramen food five will be
2:02
Ramen then I will add food
2:07
five you can see that I can send this
2:09
function any number of arguments that I
2:11
would like this function is designed to
2:13
accept any number of arguments I could
2:16
combine this function with the spread
2:17
operator when I'm displaying my Foods
2:20
array all of these elements are in an
2:21
array but I could separate them back
2:23
into separate Elements by using the
2:25
spread operator which is the same three
2:28
dots as the rest print parameters rest
2:30
parameters are used as parameters the
2:33
spread operator is used whenever you
2:34
have an array or any sort of collection
2:36
of something so now when I combine the
2:39
rest parameters and the spread
2:41
operator I can display all of my
2:43
separate
2:44
elements you can even use rest
2:46
parameters to stick all elements within
2:49
an array so this time I'm going to
2:51
create a separate
2:52
function to get
2:57
food we will use rest parameters
3:00
our array name will be Foods all we're
3:04
going to do is return
3:07
Foods take all of these separate
3:09
elements stick them within an array then
3:12
return that
3:13
array so I'm going to create a new array
3:16
const
3:18
Foods
3:20
equals call our get food method pass in
3:24
a variable amount of arguments let's
3:26
pass in food
3:27
one food two
3:30
food three food four and food
3:35
five and then we got to display
3:38
it
3:40
console.log my array
3:42
Foods so that's how the rest parameters
3:44
can be used to combine elements and
3:46
bundle them into an array then if you
3:49
want you can return the array or do
3:50
whatever you want with it let's go over
example 2
3:52
a second example we'll create a method
3:55
to sum a bunch of numbers together
3:58
function sum
4:00
sum we will use rest parameter so we can
4:03
accept any number of arguments our array
4:06
name will be numbers what we'll do
4:08
within this method is have a result
4:11
result equals z we'll keep track of the
4:15
current sum within our result I'll
4:17
create a for Loop to iterate over our
4:19
array for every let number of
4:26
numbers take our result Plus plus equals
4:31
the current
4:32
number and then we are going to return
4:35
our
4:36
result now we'll have const total equals
4:42
invoke our sum function pass in as many
4:45
numbers as we would
4:46
like let's start with one oh then I
4:49
should probably display the total
4:52
console.log I'll use a template literal
4:55
your total is I'll add a place
5:00
holder
5:02
total your total is $1 let's add a few
5:05
more
5:06
arguments two the total is now $3 three
5:12
$6 four is 10 5 is
5:16
15 let's create a function to calculate
5:19
an
5:20
average let's copy our sum
5:25
function let's name this function get
5:28
Average all we have to do when returning
5:31
our result to get the average is divide
5:33
our result by the length of our numbers
5:36
array divided by numbers. length
5:39
property that will give you the average
5:42
so now const total equals get the
5:47
average maybe these are test scores one
5:50
student got a 75 another got 100 another
5:54
student has
5:56
85 90 and a 50
6:00
let's
6:02
console.log the
6:04
total the average is
example 3
6:07
80 let's go over example three you can
6:10
use the rest parameters to combine
6:12
strings together we will create a
6:14
function to combine
6:18
strings we'll send in a title like Mis a
6:21
first name such as
6:24
SpongeBob a last
6:27
name Square Pants
6:31
he's the
6:33
third we still need to make this
6:35
function though but const full name
6:39
equals whatever string is
6:42
returned all right let's work on this
6:44
function function combine string let's
6:49
make this plural
6:54
strings we need to use rest parameters
6:58
let's name our array
7:00
strings an easy way to do this is to
7:03
return our array of strings and use the
7:07
built-in join method to join all of the
7:10
strings
7:11
together but we'll add a space between
7:13
each string all right we should now have
7:17
a full name variable that's all of the
7:19
strings combined so let's
7:22
console.log our full
7:27
name Mr sponge Bob SquarePants the third
7:31
that's one way in which you could use
7:33
the rest parameters to combine a bunch
7:35
of strings into one such as if you're
7:37
creating a full name all right everybody
7:40
so those are rest parameters they allow
7:42
a function to work with a variable
7:44
number of arguments by bundling them
7:47
into an array it's the opposite of the
7:49
spread operator the spread operator
7:51
expands an array into separate elements
7:53
the rest parameters bundle separate
7:55
elements into an array and well
7:58
everybody those are rest parameters in
8:04
