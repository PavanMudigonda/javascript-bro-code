why hello so today I need to explain
0:02
const const short for constants are
0:05
variables that can't be changed once you
0:07
assign them in this example we're going
0:09
to create a program to calculate the
0:11
circumference of a circle given a radius
0:14
let's define our variables first we have
0:16
Pi we'll begin with using let then I'll
0:18
show you the benefit of using const so
0:21
let pi equals I'll use the first few
0:25
digits of pi
0:28
3.14159
0:30
then we have let radius which we will
0:33
assign later we'll ask for user input
0:35
then let
0:38
circumference I think I spelled that
0:39
right I can never spell
0:41
circumference all right now we need to
0:44
ask the user what the radius is I will
0:46
just use a window prompt radius equals
0:50
window.
0:53
prompt enter the radius of a circle
1:02
then once we have our radius when we
1:04
accept user input it's a string data
1:07
type we need to convert our radius into
1:09
a number by using the number
1:13
function then once we have our radius we
1:16
can calculate the circumference by
1:18
setting circumference equal to and
1:21
here's the Formula 2 * pi * our radius
1:25
that the user enters in then once we
1:27
have our circumference let's cons
1:30
log R
1:33
circumference let's see if this
1:37
works enter the radius of a circle I'll
1:40
enter 10 press okay their circumference
1:44
is
1:45
62.8 so why might you want to use a
1:47
const in this program you may
1:49
accidentally or somebody else may
1:52
maliciously change the value of a
1:54
variable so that the program doesn't
1:56
behave as intended for example somewhere
1:59
within my program I will set pi to be a
2:02
new number pi equal 420.69 let's run
2:07
this program again enter the radius of a
2:09
circle I'll enter 10 press okay and my
2:12
circumference is
2:15
8,413 I may not realize that this is the
2:18
incorrect answer just for an extra
2:21
security measure I can turn any
2:23
variables that shouldn't change to be a
2:26
const a constant replace let with
2:30
const and it is a good practice if you
2:32
have any constants to make all of the
2:34
letters in the variable name uppercase
2:37
so Pi is now Capital Pi hey this is bro
2:40
from the future there's one thing I
2:42
needed to clarify that I forgot to
2:43
mention capitalizing your constants is
2:46
usually only done with primitive data
2:48
types such as numbers and booleans
2:50
reference data types such as strings
2:52
don't normally follow this convention
2:54
you'll see this in the next few upcoming
2:56
videos Pi is a constant and we're
2:58
assigning a number that's why I'm making
3:00
it all uppercase but if this was a
3:01
string normally we wouldn't that is all
3:04
let's try and change that variable again
3:07
pial 420.69
3:11
so we have an uncaught type error
3:14
assignment to constant variable so
3:18
JavaScript won't let us reassign
3:20
constants once they are assigned once we
3:23
can't make any changes to it once you
3:25
declare a constant you can't change the
3:27
value and that's pretty helpful in a lot
3:29
of circumstance stances it's an extra
3:31
security measure what we'll do this time
3:33
is within our web page we will accept
3:35
some user input via a text boox we'll
3:38
rewrite the same
3:40
program let's create an H1
3:42
element I will set the ID of the H1
3:46
element to be my
3:48
H1 and the text will be enter the radius
3:53
of a
3:57
circle I'll create a text box
4:00
input I'll set the type equal to text
4:04
the ID equal to my
4:09
text I'll create a label for this input
4:12
text
4:17
box let's say
4:21
radius I'll add a
4:26
button the button will say submit
4:31
the ID will be my
4:34
submit then I'll add two
4:37
breaks right after the text box to make
4:39
it look
4:41
nice let's get rid of
4:44
console.log when we click on the submit
4:46
button we will execute a function we
4:49
need to select the
4:50
button let's take our document get
4:55
element by
4:57
ID the ID is is my
5:02
submit follow this with DOT
5:06
onclick
5:08
equals a function parenthesis curly
5:11
braces when we click on the button we'll
5:14
execute any code within the curly braces
5:17
we can eliminate our window
5:20
prompt we need to get the value from the
5:22
text box again we can use document.
5:25
getet element by ID but the ID is going
5:29
to be my text the text from the text
5:32
box dot value get the value from the
5:36
text box and we will assign that to
5:41
radius then we will typ cast our input
5:44
as a
5:48
number then we will calculate the
5:52
circumference but since Pi is a constant
5:55
make sure that the letters are uppercase
5:57
uppercase pi
6:00
once we have our circumference let's
6:01
change an H3 element so let's add that
6:04
as
6:05
well
6:07
H3 the ID will be my H3 there will be no
6:13
text
6:14
content then again we will get element
6:17
by
6:18
ID the ID will be my
6:22
H3 change the text content of this
6:26
element to equal our circumference
6:32
okay let's try this the radius is 10
6:34
press submit and here is our
6:37
circumference maybe this will be in
6:40
centimeters so let me change that I'll
6:43
use string concatenation and just add
6:45
plus
6:47
CM so 10 submit 62.83 CM if I attempt to
6:54
change the value of
6:56
pi maybe I'll do that here pi = 420.69
7:02
rerun the program 10 submit there
7:06
doesn't appear to be a result so if we
7:09
go to Dev tools go to console we have
7:12
that uncaught type error assignment to
7:15
constant variable so again we can't
7:17
change the value of a constant there are
7:20
more graceful ways of handling this
7:22
we'll learn about that when we get to
7:24
exception handling however this is what
7:26
we wanted we do not want to be able to
7:28
change the value of a constant all right
7:30
everybody so those are constants it's
7:32
just a variable that can't be changed
7:34
once you assign it a value and well
7:36
those are constants in
7:40
