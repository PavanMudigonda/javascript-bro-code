0:04
because well programming can sometimes
0:06
involve a lot of math operands are
0:08
values variables Etc in this equation 11
0:12
x and 5 are all operands operators they
0:17
can include but are not limited to
0:19
addition subtraction multiplication and
0:21
division in this equation the addition
0:24
sign would be the operator so there's a
0:26
few things you should know regarding
0:28
arithmetic operators in JavaScript so
0:30
let's begin let's pretend that in the
0:33
scenario we are a teacher we have a
0:35
group of students let students equals
0:39
what's a good class size maybe 30
0:41
students then I will console DOT log
0:45
my students variable
0:50
and it should be 30. let's say that a
0:53
new student joins the class and I need
0:55
to change this variable to increase
0:57
students by one I can say students
1:00
equals this will reassign my variable
1:03
equals the current value of students
1:06
plus one
1:07
now we have 31 students now for
1:11
subtraction that is the minus sign
1:13
to subtract a student we can reassign
1:15
our variable students equals students
1:19
minus one
1:20
now we have 29
1:23
then we have multiplication which is
1:25
represented by an asterisk
1:28
we will double the number of students we
1:30
have students equal students
1:33
asterisk 2 to multiply by 2. we have 60
1:37
students
1:39
division is a forward slash
1:42
we will split our class of students into
1:45
two students divided by two we now have
1:49
15.
1:50
all right then we have exponents
1:53
exponents is represented by double
1:55
asterisks
1:57
what is students to the power of two
2:03
900 students that is a very large class
2:06
maybe it's a lecture or something in a
2:08
college so students to the power of
2:10
three that would be
2:12
students to the power of three would be
2:15
twenty seven thousand
2:17
double asterisks is the exponent
2:19
operator
2:22
here's another helpful one it is the
2:24
modulus operator
2:26
it gives you the remainder of any
2:27
division
2:28
so let's say we are going to divide our
2:31
class into two so modulus which is
2:34
represented as a percent sign two
2:37
well 30 divides by 2 evenly so the
2:40
remainder is zero if we had a class of
2:43
31 students well there's one remainder
2:46
one student
2:48
students modulus 3 would divide my class
2:51
of 31 students into three we would still
2:54
have one student remaining since we're
2:57
reassigning students we would be
2:59
replacing 31 students with the value of
3:02
one if you're using the modulus operator
3:04
I would recommend creating a separate
3:06
variable entirely
3:07
let
3:09
extra students equal our students
3:12
modulus 3. we have one extra student
3:17
just one okay that is the modulus
3:20
operator
augmented assignment operators
3:21
there is a shortcut for writing these
3:23
Expressions because it can be kind of
3:25
tedious to write the variable name twice
3:26
so let's set students back to 30.
3:30
I will console.log students
3:33
we'll use what is known as augmented
3:35
assignment operators
3:37
to increase students by a number
3:39
if we're reassigning it we can say
3:41
students plus equals one or some other
3:44
number students is now 31 if I were to
3:48
change 1 to B2 it's now 32
3:51
and 33.
3:53
let's do the same thing with subtraction
3:56
students minus equals one
3:59
we now have 29 students
4:02
multiplication
4:04
students
4:06
times equals to
4:08
that would give us 60 students
4:13
students divided by equals to we have 15
4:17
students
4:20
all right then exponents
4:23
students to the power
4:25
of equals two
4:28
900 students
4:31
then modulus
4:34
students modulus equals two
4:39
we have no remaining students 30 divides
4:42
by two evenly so another place where
4:44
modulus could be helpful is if you're
4:46
determining if a number is even a odd 30
4:48
is an even number divided by 2 the
4:50
remainder is 0. 31 is odd the remainder
increment/decrement operators
4:54
is 1. there's also the increment and
4:56
decrement operator there's a couple
4:58
different ways to add one to a variable
5:00
but you should be aware of all of them
5:02
to increase a variable by only one you
5:05
can take the name of the variable then
5:07
add plus plus
5:08
plus plus is the increment operator 30
5:12
incremented by one is Thirty-One then
5:15
there is the decrement operator which is
5:17
minus minus
5:19
30 decremented by 1 is 29. all right
operator precedence
5:23
then lastly we're going to cover
5:25
operator precedence
5:27
this is pretty important given a very
5:30
complex equation such as this example in
5:33
which order do you solve each part of
5:35
this equation so with operator
5:37
precedence beginning with the left
5:39
working our way to the right you would
5:41
solve anything with parentheses then
5:43
exponents multiplication and division
5:46
and modulo otherwise known as modulus
5:49
then lastly addition and subtraction
5:51
let's go through this step by step let's
5:53
see what the results variable is I will
5:56
console.log
5:58
result
6:00
so the result is 23.
6:02
so if we were to walk through this step
6:04
by step let's solve anything with
6:06
parentheses
6:07
starting from the left and then working
6:09
our way to the right there are no
6:10
parentheses we can skip this step next
6:13
is exponents there is one exponent here
6:16
so we would solve 4 to the power of 2
6:18
which is 16.
6:21
then we will solve multiplication and
6:24
division and modulus that's addition we
6:26
skip that we have multiplication two
6:29
times three is six
6:31
there is no more multiplication division
6:33
or modulus
6:35
then lastly addition and subtraction
6:38
one plus six is seven seven plus sixteen
6:41
is our result of 23.
6:44
all right I'll give you a few more
6:45
exercises
6:47
how about this equation
6:49
the result is going to be six
6:52
so there's no parentheses no exponents
6:55
we do have a modulus operator here so we
6:57
solve that first
6:59
12 modulus 5 gives us a remainder of two
7:04
we have some division we would solve
7:06
that next eight divided by 2 is 4 then
7:09
addition and subtraction the result is
7:11
six
7:13
all right here's a challenge round
7:15
the result is going to be .0468
7:19
we solve anything with parentheses first
7:22
two plus five that is seven
7:25
then exponents 2 to the power of seven
7:28
I might need a calculator
7:30
two times two three four five six seven
7:35
that's 128.
7:37
then we have 6 divided by 128 then we
7:41
have six divided by 128 which is point
7:45
zero four six eight seven five
7:49
and that is our result
conclusion
7:51
all right everybody so that is
7:53
everything you need to know about
7:54
arithmetic operators you have operands
7:57
which are values and variables in
7:59
arithmetic expression and operators
8:01
there's also augmented assignment
8:03
operators which is a shortcut to writing
8:05
these equations if you're going to
8:06
reassign a variable then you have
8:08
increment and decrement operators to
8:10
increase a variable by one or decrease
8:13
it by one
8:14
then with operator precedence if you're
8:16
solving a complex equation you solve
8:18
each part of the equation following this
8:20
order and well that is everything you
8:22
need to know regarding arithmetic
8:23
operators and JavaScript
