hey hello there so today I'm going to
0:02
explain Arrow functions in JavaScript an
0:04
arrow function is a concise way to write
0:06
a function expression it's good for
0:09
simple functions that you only use once
0:11
here's the formula you have your
0:13
parameters Arrow then some code you
0:15
would like to perform here's an example
0:18
suppose I have a function declaration I
0:21
have the hello function I'll we're going
0:24
to do is
0:25
console.log the word hello to use this
0:29
function I need to call it by its name
0:31
add a set of parentheses this will
0:33
display the word hello a concise way to
example 1
0:36
write the same function is to use an
0:38
arrow function we'll begin with a
0:40
function expression then convert it to
0:41
an arrow function just so we understand
0:43
the differences this time I will create
0:46
a constant hello hello is going to be a
0:49
constant that stores our function
0:52
expression if I were using a function
0:54
expression we would say function
0:57
parenthesis curly braces then the code
0:59
we want to perform console.log the
1:04
word hello this would do the same thing
1:08
hello a more concise way to write this
1:11
function expression would be to use an
1:13
arrow
1:14
function following this formula we list
1:17
our parameters we don't have any we need
1:19
a set of parenthesis Arrow then some
1:22
code we would like to perform I'm going
1:24
to console.log the word
1:28
hello and that
1:30
works we're sticking an arrow function
1:33
within a variable or named constant to
1:36
invoke the arrow function within we just
1:38
follow that constant or variable with
1:39
the set of parentheses like we're
1:41
calling it as if it's a pair of
1:42
telephones talking to each other you can
1:45
send some arguments to an arrow function
1:47
we'll need to set up the parameters I
1:49
will have a name parameter within our
1:52
code let's console.log I'll use a
1:55
template string hello add a placeholder
1:59
add my name
2:00
parameter now I need to pass in an
2:02
argument because right now it's hello
2:06
undefined pass in your first name is an
2:09
argument hello bro within your code if
2:12
you need to include more than one
2:14
statement you'll need to enclose all of
2:16
that code within a set of curly
2:18
braces let's add a new
2:22
line
2:25
console.log you are
2:27
old hello bro you are
2:30
old okay let's set up another parameter
2:33
this time we will accept an age
2:37
argument let's transform our second
2:39
console.log to be you are at a
2:44
placeholder our parameter
2:47
age years
2:49
old now we'll pass in a second argument
2:52
for age hello bro you are 25 years old
2:57
so that's the basics of an arrow
2:58
function you have your parameter ERS
3:00
Arrow then some code you would like to
3:02
perform there's no need to create a
3:04
function
3:04
declaration let's go over another
example 2
3:07
example we have the set timeout
3:11
function this function accepts a call
3:14
back then a given amount of time we are
3:16
then going to execute this code this
3:19
callback after 3 seconds 3,000
3:22
milliseconds I will execute whatever
3:24
this call back is let's create a
3:26
function to say hello again function
3:31
hello we will
3:34
console.log the word hello I will pass
3:38
in a call back after 3 seconds we
3:42
say hello in place of a call back I
3:46
could use a function expression let's
3:48
cut our
3:52
function remove this argument then paste
3:55
our function expression remember we
3:57
don't need the name for a function
3:58
expression this works as
4:02
well hello or otherwise we can use a
4:05
more concise Arrow function we will pass
4:08
that as an argument we have our
4:10
parameters we don't have any Arrow then
4:13
some code
4:16
console.log the word hello after 3
4:20
seconds we display the
4:22
word hello now we'll use Arrow functions
example 3
4:25
with map filter and
4:27
reduce we have an array of numbers const
4:31
numbers equals the numbers 1 through
4:37
six let's start with using the map
4:40
filter to square each of these numbers
4:43
but we will use Arrow
4:46
functions const
4:50
squares equals our original array
4:53
numbers. map normally we would pass in a
4:57
call back as an argument but we're not
4:59
going to do that we'll use an arrow
5:02
function we have one
5:05
parameter an
5:08
element
5:09
arrow take each element use
5:13
math.pow to raise our element to a given
5:17
power then let's console.log our
5:21
squares console.log squares there they
5:24
are here are all the original numbers
5:26
squared 1 4 9 16 25
5:30
36 let's Cube each
5:34
number const
5:37
cubes raise our element to the power of
5:40
three console.log are
5:43
cubes there are all the numbers
5:46
cubed we'll use the filter method to
5:49
filter out any numbers that are odd
5:52
const even nums equals rray
5:57
numbers we will use the filter method
5:59
method we can pass in a call back but we
6:01
don't need to we will pass in an arrow
6:05
function we have our element as a
6:08
parameter
6:10
Arrow we don't necessarily need a return
6:13
statement if we have only one line of
6:16
code take our element modulus 2 is it
6:21
divisible by two and does the strictly
6:24
equal zero if it does it's an even
6:26
number let's console.log our even number
6:30
2
6:30
46 let's do this with odd
6:34
numbers odd
6:38
nums take our element modulus 2 is it
6:41
strictly not equal to
6:44
zero display our odd nums 1
6:48
35 and lastly let's do reduce we will
6:51
get a total by summing all of the
6:53
elements of this array const total
6:57
equals our original array
7:00
do reduce pass in a call back or an
7:03
arrow function this time we have two
7:05
arguments an
7:08
accumulator and an
7:11
element we have an
7:13
Arrow return our accumulator plus our
7:19
element then display the
7:22
total our total is
7:24
21 all right everybody so those are
conclusion
7:26
Arrow functions they're a concise way to
7:29
write a function expression they're good
7:31
for simple functions that you only use
7:33
once you list your parameters within a
7:36
set of parentheses an arrow then some
7:39
code you would like to perform in this
7:41
example we've written a more concise way
7:43
to use the map filter and reduce methods
7:46
normally we can pass in a call back as
7:47
an argument a function expression or an
7:50
arrow function and well everybody those
7:53
are Arrow functions in
7:58
JavaScript
