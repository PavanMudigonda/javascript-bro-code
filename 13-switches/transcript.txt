example 1
0:00
hey what's going on everybody so today
0:01
I'm going to explain switches a switch
0:03
can be an efficient replacement to using
0:06
many else if statements here's an
0:08
example of a program I wrote without
0:10
using a switch we have a day day will
0:13
normally be the number 1 through 7even
0:15
if day equals 1 will console.log it is
0:18
Monday which you can see here if day was
0:21
two well then it's Tuesday all the way
0:23
up to 7 which is Sunday I do have an
0:26
else statement that states our day
0:29
variable is not a day for example if I
0:31
set day to be I don't know like a string
0:33
of
0:34
pizza well then Pizza is not a day but
0:37
it really should be if you find yourself
0:40
using a lot of else if statements I
0:42
would instead recommend creating a
0:44
switch here's how to create one we'll
0:47
keep our day variable I'll set that to
0:50
be one to create a switch we will type
0:52
switch parentheses curly braces within
0:56
the parenthesis of the switch we will
0:58
place a variable or a value what are we
1:01
examining let's examine our day
1:04
variable we examine a value against
1:07
matching cases to create a case type
1:10
case then a value or a condition we will
1:14
see if day equals one so day case one
1:19
are these two values equal if they are
1:22
then we can do something we can execute
1:24
some code so add a colon then any code
1:28
underneath this case will be ex executed
1:30
if there's a match between our value or
1:32
variable day and this value so let's
1:39
console.log it is
1:42
Monday then be sure to add a break I'll
1:45
demonstrate why you need break later so
1:48
day is
1:49
one it is Monday let's add another case
1:53
for case 2 in case day equals 2 so let's
1:57
copy and paste what we have
2:00
case two it is
2:03
Tuesday let's change day to B2 it is
2:06
Tuesday all right let's do this all the
2:09
way up to case
2:28
seven
2:33
all right we have cases 1 through 7 if I
2:36
change day to be S well then it is
2:40
Sunday you can also add a default case
2:43
in case there are no
2:45
matches now what if we set day to be
2:48
Pizza which doesn't make sense well
2:51
there are no matching cases once we
2:54
review all of the cases and there's no
2:56
matches we exit the switch you also have
2:59
the the capability to add a default case
3:02
in case there are no
3:04
matches what's the default behavior of
3:06
the switch if there's no matching cases
3:09
let's
3:13
console.log I should probably use a
3:14
template literal for this if we're
3:16
inserting a
3:17
variable our day
3:20
variable is not a day so now we should
3:24
execute this default case Pizza is not a
break
3:28
day all right now the reason that we
3:30
have these break statements is to break
3:33
out of the switch once we have a
3:34
matching case I'll demonstrate what
3:36
happens if we remove
3:42
these all right let's set day to be two
3:46
as in Tuesday it is Tuesday it is
3:49
Wednesday it is Thursday it is Friday it
3:50
is Saturday it is Sunday two is not a
3:52
day so the reason that we have these
3:54
breakes is to break out of the switch if
3:57
we don't have them once we have a
3:58
matching case
4:00
we will execute the code found within
4:02
that space then Cascade down and execute
4:05
any code that follows after including
4:07
code within different cases so that's
4:10
why you want these break statements
4:11
after each case to break out of the
4:13
switch let's go over a more complex
example 2
4:17
example let's say we have a test score
4:20
variable between 0 and 100 my score will
4:24
be 92
4:26
92% I will also create a letter grade
4:29
variable
4:31
which we will declare but not aign I'm
4:34
going to examine our test score so
4:37
another way in which you can write a
4:38
switch is something like
4:40
this I'm going to examine the value of
4:44
true against matching cases which
4:46
contain a condition so case then I'll
4:50
write a
4:51
condition is test score greater than or
4:54
equal to 90 as in
4:58
90% this condition will evaluate to be
5:01
true or false if true is equal to true
5:05
we will do some code if this is false we
5:08
skip over it if our test score is
5:10
greater than or equal to 90 let's assign
5:12
our letter grade variable to equal an a
5:17
then be sure to
5:19
break then I'm going to test this with
5:23
console.log we will display our letter
5:27
grade we have an A let's do this for
5:30
anything greater than 80 the user will
5:32
receive a
5:33
B test score greater than or equal to 80
5:37
letter grade will equal
5:39
B let's change our test score to be 85
5:42
the user receives a
5:44
b let's follow this pattern 70 will be a
5:52
c yep
5:54
C 60 will be a
5:58
d
6:06
60 is D then for the default
6:10
case I will set letter grade to be
6:14
F letter grade equals
6:19
F if I set my test score to be 33% so
6:23
with the test score of 33 the letter
6:25
grade is f all right everybody so that's
6:28
a switch if if you find you're using a
6:30
lot of L if statements I would recommend
6:32
using a switch instead it's not bad if
6:34
you have a few but if you have many I
6:37
would use a switch instead and well
6:39
everybody those are switches in
6:43
