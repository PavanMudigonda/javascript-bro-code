Intro
0:00
hey what's going on everybody so in
0:02
today's video we're going to create a
0:03
counter program using JavaScript HTML
0:06
and CSS so sit back relax and enjoy the
0:10
show
0:11
all right let's begin everybody so what
0:13
we're going to do is start with our
0:16
index.html file we'll add any necessary
0:19
elements then we will style those
0:21
elements with our CSS file then lastly
0:24
we will add functionality via JavaScript
HTML
0:27
so let's begin with our HTML file
0:30
within the body of our document I will
0:34
create a label to store the count
0:36
so I will create a label
0:40
with an ID
0:42
of count
0:44
label the text will be zero
0:48
it's a little small but that's okay
0:50
we'll increase the font size with CSS
0:53
I'll add a break afterwards with the
0:56
brake tag
0:57
we'll need three buttons decrease reset
1:00
and increase
1:04
so we have button one
1:06
let's copy this button paste it two
1:09
additional times
1:11
the ID for the first button will be
1:15
decrease
1:17
btn4 button
1:21
the text will be decrease
1:27
then for the second button the ID will
1:30
be reset button
1:33
the text will be reset
1:36
then increase ID
1:40
increase
1:41
button
1:43
the text will be increase
1:48
what I'm also going to do is place our
1:50
buttons within a div section
1:54
let's cut our buttons
1:57
then place the buttons within the div
2:01
I will give the div a unique ID
2:05
of button
2:07
container
2:09
we'll Center align our button container
2:11
so it's in the middle of the window
2:13
okay that is everything we need with our
2:15
HTML file let's move to our CSS file
CSS
2:19
let's style the account label it's a
2:22
little small right now
2:23
I will select the ID
2:26
count label
2:31
I will display the label
2:33
as a block level element
2:37
I will text align Center so it's in the
2:40
center of our screen
2:43
let's increase the font size
2:47
I tend to like to use the EM unit of
2:50
measurement
2:51
the text will be 10 times the size
2:55
then let's change the font family
2:58
pick a font of your choosing for this
3:00
example I'll use helvetica
3:08
let's Center the button container that
3:11
should surround all three buttons
3:13
as you can see here
3:16
the ID was button
3:19
container
3:22
text align Center
3:27
okay the buttons should be in the middle
3:31
one thing I forgot to do let's actually
3:33
add a class to our buttons too
3:36
class equals
3:40
buttons
3:45
there
3:47
all right we will select the buttons
3:49
class
3:51
I'll add some padding
3:54
padding 10 pixels and 20 pixels
4:01
let's increase the font size font size
4:03
1.5 em
4:06
that translates to 150 percent
4:10
let's pick a font color
4:12
I'll just pick White
4:15
then a background color for the buttons
4:17
background Dash color
4:20
I'll use hsl values
4:27
how's that
4:28
not feeling it
4:31
that's pretty good
4:36
let's round the corners with border
4:38
radius
4:40
5 pixels
4:44
I'll change the cursor into a pointer
4:46
when we hover over a button
4:49
cursor
4:51
pointer
4:54
then we'll add a transition animation
5:00
transition
5:03
background
5:06
Dash color
5:07
after 0.25 seconds
5:11
then we'll apply the hover pseudo class
5:13
when we hover over one of the buttons
5:16
take our buttons class
5:19
use the hoverseudo class
5:22
we will change the background color
5:25
after a quarter of a second then change
5:28
the background color to something
5:30
slightly darker
5:38
yeah that looks good
5:40
there should be a delay when you hover
5:42
over one of the buttons
5:44
our HTML file is done same with our CSS
5:46
now we need to add functionality because
5:49
well these buttons don't do anything
5:51
I will individually assign all of these
5:54
buttons so that each is stored within a
5:56
constant
JavaScript
5:58
so const
6:01
decrease
6:02
button
6:03
equals then we need to select each
6:06
button by accessing our document dot get
6:09
element by ID
6:13
what's the id we're selecting we will
6:15
begin with our decrease button
6:21
all right
6:22
then we need our reset button
6:26
reset button the ID is reset button
6:31
then increase button
6:35
increase button
6:37
the ID is increase button
6:42
we need our count label
6:45
okay then we will set const
6:49
count label
6:52
equals then we need to get the ID of our
6:54
count label
6:57
so
6:58
document.getelementbyid count label
7:05
then we will use let count
7:09
equals zero
7:12
we'll be reassigning count we'll be
7:15
incrementing and decrementing count with
7:17
our HTML elements we do not plan on
7:20
reassigning them so we can set them as
7:22
constants
7:23
now we need a few functions three
7:25
functions
7:26
one for each of these buttons decrease
7:28
reset increase let's begin with increase
7:33
so we are taking our increase button
7:35
that we assigned
7:37
with the on click attribute of this
7:40
button set the SQL to a function
7:44
What's it gonna do when we want to
7:46
increase this value of our count label
7:49
let's increment count by one count plus
7:52
plus
7:54
then we will set the text content of our
7:56
label
7:58
count label dot text
8:01
content equals whatever the count
8:04
currently is let's see if this works
8:09
it looks like I misspelled on click
8:12
all right let's see if this works
8:15
yep every time we press the button our
8:17
counter label increases by one
8:20
okay let's work on decrease
8:22
really we can just copy this function
8:26
paste it let's change increase to
8:28
decrease
8:31
count minus minus
8:34
save everything
8:37
and we should be able to increase and
8:39
decrease
8:41
then the reset button
8:43
let's copy one of these functions
8:46
change decrease button to reset button
8:50
when we want to reset we will set count
8:53
back to zero
8:54
then update our account label with the
8:57
current count which should be zero
8:59
we can increase
9:01
we can decrease and we can reset
9:04
then increase and decrease again
9:07
all right everybody so that is a counter
9:09
program with JavaScript HTML and CSS
