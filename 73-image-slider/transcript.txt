hey what's going on everybody so in
0:01
today's video I'm going to show you how
0:03
we can create an image slider program
0:05
using JavaScript you will need some
0:07
images to work with I would recommend
0:09
finding three or more somewhat related
0:11
images to whatever you would like to
0:13
create an image slider for once you find
0:15
your images put them within your website
0:16
folder and we are ready to begin okay
0:19
let's do this thing everybody so we will
0:21
create a development to contain
0:23
everything this development will have a
0:25
class of
0:27
slider within this development we will
0:29
create another div element this
0:32
development will have a class of slides
0:35
to contain our images within this inner
0:37
div element we will create three image
0:40
elements the first image will have a
0:43
class of
0:45
slide with this image element I will set
0:47
the source attribute to be a relative or
0:50
absolute file path let's begin with
0:53
image one whatever you currently have
0:55
I'll copy the name of this image
0:56
including the
0:58
extension so my my image has a name of
1:01
image 1.jpg and for some reason if this
1:04
image can't display I'll add some
1:05
alternative text with the alt attribute
1:08
let's say image number
1:12
one and there is my image I will copy
1:15
this image element paste it twice or
1:19
once for every image that you have then
1:21
I have image two and image three let me
1:24
change those we have image 2 and image
1:28
three so you should have three or more
1:31
images depending on what pictures you're
1:33
using and how many then we're going to
1:35
add some Arrow buttons for the time
1:37
being that will be down at the
1:39
bottom so we will create a button
1:42
element now you could use a left angle
1:44
bracket let me zoom in but I think
1:48
there's a better option there's a
1:49
Unicode character for a left pointing
1:52
angle bracket which looks like this we
1:54
will use the Unicode character of
1:57
Ampersand # 1
2:00
094 I think that looks better but you do
2:03
you all right then let's create a right
2:05
angle bracket with another button the
2:08
number is
2:11
one95 so that will create a button with
2:14
an arrow that points to the right for
2:16
the previous button the left one I will
2:18
assign a class of prev meaning
2:22
previous and the next button will have a
2:24
class of
2:26
next when we click on these buttons
2:29
we'll call A JavaScript function we need
2:31
to set the onclick vent Handler equal to
2:34
a JavaScript function for the previous
2:36
button we'll call a function of prev
2:39
slide meaning
2:41
previous and for the next button we will
2:44
call a function of next slide to go to
2:48
the next
2:50
slide okay and that is all the HTML that
2:53
we need for now let's go to our CSS
2:56
stylesheet we will select our class of
2:59
slider that contains everything class
3:02
slider we're going to use relative
3:06
positioning these elements will move
3:08
relative to their normal position using
3:11
relative so we have position relative I
3:15
will set a width of
3:17
100% as well as margin Auto to Center
3:20
everything
3:21
horizontally now just in case if our
3:23
images are really big I will set the
3:25
Overflow property to be hidden so take
3:28
our class of slider
3:30
select all the images with these images
3:33
I will set their width to be
3:35
100% and for now I will set the display
3:38
property to be none we don't want to
3:41
display all the images right away so
3:43
they should
3:44
disappear let's add a little bit of
3:46
functionality before continuing let's go
3:48
to our Javascript file I'm going to
3:51
create a node list of all the images
3:54
within our class of slides so I will
3:56
create a constant of slides which will
3:59
will be a node list equals
4:02
document. query selector all we will
4:07
select all elements within the class of
4:10
slides that are images image elements we
4:14
will also declare an index of the
4:15
current slide let slide index so this
4:19
will be zero initially to start at the
4:22
first slide we'll be using the set
4:24
interval function set interval will
4:27
return an ID that we can work with so we
4:29
will declare a variable to hold to that
4:32
let
4:34
interval ID for now I'll set it to be
4:37
null meaning no
4:38
value okay let's declare our functions
4:42
we will have a function to
4:45
initialize our
4:47
slider this will populate our web
4:49
browser with the first image when we
4:51
call this function then we need a
4:53
function for show Slide there will be
4:57
one parameter an index
5:01
an index of the next slide we would like
5:02
to go
5:03
to a function for the previous slide
5:07
prev slide and a function for next slide
5:12
function next
5:15
slide within our function of initialized
5:18
slider we will take our node list of
5:21
slides at index of our current slide
5:24
index which will be zero initially I
5:27
will access the class list
5:30
and add a
5:32
class of display slide which we still
5:36
need to work with and then we will call
5:38
this function right
5:41
away okay we need to build this class
5:43
still display
5:45
slide we will select all image elements
5:48
that have a class within their class
5:50
list of display
5:54
slide if an image has this class we will
5:57
set their display property to display as
6:00
a block we should get our first
6:03
image if you would like although it's
6:06
not necessary we could display this
6:09
image after all of the Dom content loads
6:12
by using an event listener here's how if
6:14
you would prefer to wait for all the Dom
6:16
content to load we can take our
6:19
document add an event
6:22
listener we will wait for the event of
6:26
Dom content loaded
6:30
once all of the Dom content loads pass
6:33
in a call back to initialize slider so
6:36
this would work too and I would say it's
6:37
the preferred way rather than just
6:39
calling this function initially wait for
6:41
all the Dom content to load then display
6:44
our first image by calling this function
6:46
within the initialized slider function
6:49
we will use the set interval
6:52
function we will call the next slide
6:55
function after a given amount of seconds
6:58
let's say after 5 seconds I would like
7:01
to go to the next slide and display the
7:02
next image whatever is next within our
7:05
node list in order for us to work with
7:07
this interval this function is going to
7:09
return an interval ID so we can clear it
7:12
later if we need to we will take our
7:14
interval ID set it equal to the set
7:17
interval
7:18
function so I'm going to
7:22
console.log my interval ID just to see
7:24
what it is so let's save and run
7:28
everything go to console so this
7:31
interval has an ID of one if I need to
7:34
clear this set interval function I can
7:36
access it by its ID which is currently
7:39
one and we can get rid of this
7:41
line to avoid displaying an image if we
7:44
don't have one we can wrap these two
7:46
lines of code within an if
7:48
statement we will check if our node list
7:52
of slides its length property is greater
7:56
than zero if we do have slides
8:00
then display it and use the set interval
8:02
function if there's no slides no images
8:06
then don't do
8:08
this okay then we're going to go to the
8:10
next slide
8:11
function we're going to increment slide
8:14
index by one slide index
8:17
Plus+ and then we will call the show
8:20
slide function pass in our slide index
8:23
after incrementing it and that is all we
8:25
need for next slide then we have the
8:27
show slide function with in our show
8:29
slide function we will access our node
8:32
list of
8:34
slides use the for each method to
8:37
iterate through all of them I would like
8:39
to take each slide Arrow do this take
8:44
each slide access its class
8:47
list then remove a class from the class
8:50
list we will remove the class of display
8:55
slide if it's time to move to the next
8:57
slide we don't want to display the
8:59
current slide anymore we'll remove
9:01
display slide so that it's no longer
9:04
displaying as a block remove these
9:06
properties then outside of the for each
9:09
method we will add display slide to the
9:11
next slide then we will take our slides
9:15
at index of slide
9:18
index access the class list of the next
9:22
slide then we will add a new class add
9:26
the class of display slide
9:29
so that it displays as a
9:32
block and let's see if this works after
9:36
5 Seconds we should move to the next
9:39
slide and that does in fact work let's
9:42
wait again for the next
9:44
slide and that has worked
9:47
too we need to reset our slide index
9:50
because right now we're going out of
9:51
bounds we only have three slides in this
9:53
example within our show slide function
9:56
We'll add an if statement and an an lse
9:59
if
10:03
statement if we reach the end of our
10:05
slides we need to reset the slide index
10:08
and set it back to be zero if our index
10:11
that's passed
10:12
in is greater than or equal to our node
10:17
list of slides length property if we
10:20
reach the end we need to take our slide
10:22
index and reset it to be
10:24
zero now if we go backwards with the
10:27
previous button if our index is less
10:30
than
10:31
zero we will take the slide
10:34
index set it equal to our slides length
10:39
property minus one to set it to the end
10:42
if we're on the first slide and we hit
10:44
the previous button that will bring us
10:46
to the last slide these images should
10:48
Loop let's see if that does
10:56
work so we're on our green car and we
10:58
should go to our blue car car next and
11:00
that does work our initialized slider
11:03
function is done if we click on the next
11:05
button we should be able to go to the
11:06
next slide right
11:10
away now we have to work on the previous
11:12
button and add some functionality to
11:14
that within the previous slide function
11:18
we will take our slide index and
11:20
decrement it with minus minus then call
11:23
the show slide function pass in the
11:25
current index now we should be able to
11:28
move forward and
11:31
back now if we hit the previous button
11:34
because we want to look at an image the
11:36
timer is still going we'll still go to
11:37
the next slide if we would like to take
11:39
some time to admire one of these images
11:41
we can clear the set interval function
11:44
by using its interval
11:45
ID so if somebody were to hit the
11:47
previous button let's clear the timer we
11:50
will use the clear interval function we
11:53
will pass in that interval
11:57
ID our set interval function is still
11:59
going to move the slides forward but if
12:01
I were to hit the previous
12:03
button that interval is going to
12:06
stop we are done with all of our
12:08
JavaScript functionality we're going to
12:10
apply some CSS styling to the buttons
12:12
and even add a transition animation to
12:14
the next
12:16
image we will style our buttons
12:19
next within our class of slider select
12:22
all
12:23
buttons I will set the position property
12:26
to be
12:27
absolute
12:30
positions an element relative to its
12:32
parent meaning the slider
12:36
element with absolute positioning I will
12:39
set the top property to be
12:42
50% these buttons will then be
12:44
positioned on the Y AIS at 50% meaning
12:47
the middle then I will use the transform
12:52
property I will translate them on the Y
12:55
AIS by minus
12:57
50% Translate Y is a function we're
13:01
moving these buttons up by 50% of the
13:04
element's height that will put this
13:06
button right in the middle take 50% of
13:08
the height of the button Move It Up by
13:10
that amount I'll increase the font size
13:14
font size 25 pixels or better yet let's
13:17
do like 2
13:19
RM okay now for the background
13:22
color I'll set it to be black but I'm
13:25
going to lower the alpha on it so it's
13:28
transparent
13:30
I'll set the alpha to be
13:32
50% and for the font color color I'll
13:36
set that to be
13:37
white okay you can see our two buttons
13:39
are overlapping currently I'm going to
13:42
remove the border around the buttons
13:44
border
13:45
none and change our cursor to be a
13:49
pointer if we hover over one of the
13:51
buttons so these buttons each have a
13:54
class previous and next let's select the
13:58
previous class
13:59
CL I will set the left property to be
14:02
zero to left align it and with the next
14:06
class that's the next button I will set
14:10
the right property to be zero to align
14:12
it to the
14:13
right I'm also going to add a little bit
14:15
of padding too around the buttons let's
14:17
add some padding
14:20
here
14:22
padding 10 pixels by 15
14:25
pixels that looks pretty good we going
14:29
to add an animation at Key frames we
14:33
need an animation name we will name this
14:35
animation fade for a fade
14:38
effect from this property of
14:43
opacity I can't spell today 0.5 meaning
14:47
50% to this property
14:52
opacity one for 100% when a new image is
14:56
displayed the opacity is going to be 50%
14:58
% so it's transparent then after the
15:01
animation is complete set it to be one
15:03
for 100% now we just have to utilize
15:06
this animation of fade all images that
15:09
have the display slide class we will set
15:12
their animation name when that image is
15:15
displayed to be fade how long do we want
15:18
this animation to take we will set the
15:20
animation duration to be about 1.5
15:25
seconds okay let's see if this works we
15:28
should get a fade animation when each
15:30
new slide
15:33
appears we can move
15:35
forward and we can move
15:38
back all right everybody so that is an
15:40
image slider that you can create using
15:42
JavaScript HTML and
15:47
CSS
