arrays
0:00
hey what's going on everybody so today
0:01
I'm going to explain arrays in
0:03
JavaScript think of an array as a
0:05
variable like structure that can hold
0:07
more than one value for example let's
0:10
say we had a variable named fruit
0:12
go ahead and pick a fruit I'll pick an
0:14
apple
0:15
our variable can store one value but we
0:18
can turn a variable into an array and it
0:21
can store more than one value and we can
0:23
do so by enclosing all values with a set
0:25
of straight brackets now my variable of
0:28
fruit is now an array it can store more
0:31
than one value just be sure that each
0:33
value is comma separated this time I'll
0:35
add an orange
0:37
and a banana
0:39
just to make it more obvious that this
0:41
is an array I'm going to add an S so
0:44
that my variable name is plural it's not
0:46
mandatory but it helps with readability
0:48
I now have an array of fruits but let me
0:51
show you something if I were to
0:53
console.log my array of fruits
0:58
well JavaScript is going to print out
1:00
all of the elements in this array each
1:02
item each value is known as an element
1:04
we have three elements if you need to
index
1:07
access an individual element following
1:09
the array you have to add an index
1:11
number in closed and straight brackets
1:13
if I would like the element at the first
1:15
position that would have an index of
1:17
zero that would give me an Apple fruits
1:21
at index of one would be orange
1:24
fruits at index of two
1:27
is banana
1:28
if I were to attempt to access the
1:30
element at index 3
1:33
well it's undefined we only have three
1:35
elements within our array zero one two
1:38
arrays always begin with zero you can
1:40
even change one of these elements by
1:42
accessing that array at a given element
1:46
let's access our array fruits at index
1:49
zero I will set the sequel to be a
1:53
coconut
1:55
so now we have coconut orange banana
1:58
let's change fruits at index one to be a
2:00
coconut Apple coconut banana
2:03
index two will be a coconut Apple orange
2:06
coconut if I set fruits at index three
2:08
to be a coconut let me console.log that
2:11
too
2:12
fruits at index three
2:14
we can add a new element to that array
array methods
2:16
otherwise to add an element there's a
2:18
built-in method of arrays
2:20
fruits dot push
2:22
to push an element to the end
2:25
I will add a coconut to the end of my
2:27
array Apple orange banana coconut
2:30
then we have pop
2:33
is going to remove the last element
2:39
Apple orange undefined the unshift
2:42
method will add an element to the
2:44
beginning
2:45
take our array use the on shift method
2:48
on shift I will add a mango to the
2:52
beginning of my array
2:54
mango Apple orange banana
2:57
then we have shift to remove an element
2:59
from the beginning fruits.shift
3:03
now we have an orange banana and my last
3:06
two elements are undefined to get the
length
3:08
length of an array there is a length
3:10
property let's create a new variable let
3:13
num of fruits to store the number of
3:17
fruits that we have
3:19
type the array name
3:21
dot length
3:24
then let's console.log
3:27
the number of fruits we have
3:29
we have three fruits I'll add another
3:31
I'll add a coconut to the end
3:33
and we have four
3:35
so that's how to get the length of an
3:37
array there's a length property
3:39
type the array name dot length we can
indexOf
3:42
find the index of an element if there's
3:44
a match
3:45
let index equals let's search for an
3:50
apple
3:51
fruits dot index of method what are we
3:55
searching for let's search for an apple
3:58
then I will display the index
4:00
so our apple is located at index 0.
4:04
let's search for an orange
4:06
that's index one
4:08
banana
4:09
that's two coconut three what if we
4:13
search for an element that doesn't exist
4:14
like a mango
4:17
well this method will return negative
4:19
one that could be helpful within an if
4:21
statement you can check to see if this
4:22
method returns negative one then if it
4:25
does that means the element wasn't found
4:26
and you can let the user know if index
4:29
equals negative one display that element
4:32
wasn't found now if you would like to
iterate an array
4:34
Loop through the elements and display
4:35
them there's an easier way to do that
4:37
you can use a for Loop
4:40
so four
4:42
there's up to three statements we'll
4:43
need a counter or some sort of index
4:46
let I equal zero that's the first
4:49
statement
4:50
we'll continue this as long as I is less
4:53
than
4:54
our fruits array dot length property
4:58
then we will increment I by One if we
5:01
have four elements we should execute
5:03
this Loop four times during each
5:05
iteration I will console.log
5:09
our fruits array
5:10
but the index instead of being like 0 1
5:14
2 3 a hard number we'll use our counter
5:17
our index of I
5:20
and let's get rid of that line now we
5:22
should Loop through all of the elements
5:23
of this array and print them out
5:25
individually using a for Loop we can
5:27
even increment by a different number
5:29
like two I plus equals two
5:32
so here we're only displaying the apple
5:34
and the banana
5:36
if I set index to be 1 then increment by
5:39
2 will display orange then coconut
5:42
so using a for Loop there's a few
5:44
different ways in which you can display
5:45
the elements of an array if you need to
5:48
display the order of this array in
5:49
Reverse we can change this around
5:52
we will set our counter I to be the
5:54
length of our array
5:56
then we'll continue as long as I is
5:58
greater than or equal to zero then I
6:02
minus minus there's one change I'm going
6:04
to make
6:05
we have undefined coconut banana orange
6:08
Apple so the length of my array is four
6:11
but if I were to access our array fruits
6:14
at index 4 where would that be zero one
6:18
two three that's out of bounds I'm going
6:20
to set our index to be fruits.length
6:23
minus one zero one two three our length
6:26
is four minus one is a total of three
6:29
now we're printing our array in Reverse
6:31
coconut banana orange Apple
enhanced for loop
6:34
there's also an enhanced for loop it's a
6:36
shortcut to displaying the elements of
6:38
an array you can write something like
6:40
this
6:41
let fruit
6:43
of array fruits
6:46
really this variable can be anything but
6:49
I like to write a singular version of my
6:51
array name
6:52
then during each iteration I will
6:54
display each fruit
6:57
Apple orange banana coconut this is an
7:00
enhanced for loop it's kind of like a
7:01
shortcut to displaying the elements of
7:03
an array if this array name were I don't
7:05
know like meets you could say let meat
7:08
of meats
7:11
and then display each meat
7:14
but of course they're still fruit that's
7:16
a shortcut you can use now to sort an
sort
7:19
array you can use the sort method
7:21
fruits dot sort
7:24
and that should sort the elements in
7:26
alphabetical order
7:27
apple banana coconut orange
reverse sort
7:30
to sort them in reverse order you can
7:32
tack on the reverse method to the end
7:36
fruits.sortmethod.reverse method
7:38
now they're all backwards in Reverse
7:40
alphabetical order orange coconut banana
7:43
apple
conclusion
7:44
all right everybody so that's an
7:46
introduction to arrays we'll have a lot
7:48
of practice with this in the future so
7:49
if you don't remember everything that's
7:51
okay an array is a variable like
7:53
structure that can hold more than one
7:55
value a variable can hold one value an
7:58
array can hold many and well everybody
8:00
those are arrays in JavaScript
