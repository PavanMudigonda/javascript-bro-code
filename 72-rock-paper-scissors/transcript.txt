hey what's going on everybody in today's
0:01
video we're going to create a game of
0:03
rock paper scissors using JavaScript so
0:05
sit back relax and enjoy the show all
0:08
right let's do this thing we're going to
0:11
create an H1 heading with text of rock
0:15
paper scissors for a
0:17
title we'll create three buttons the
0:20
first one will be for rock you can add
0:23
some text of rock but you know what I
0:26
like using emojis I'm going to use an
0:28
emoji instead I would like an emoji of a
0:32
fist and I'm going to zoom in until we
0:35
add some CSS let's create a button for
0:39
paper that'll
0:43
work and
0:46
scissors maybe a p
0:48
sign with each of these buttons I will
0:51
set the onclick event handler equal to a
0:54
JavaScript function we'll name the
0:56
function play game now with these
0:59
functions we're going to to pass in an
1:00
argument the first will be a string of
1:03
rock now if you use double quotes HTML
1:06
is going to be confused where this event
1:08
handler ends our argument is going to be
1:10
a string but it's going to be within
1:12
single quotes because we're already
1:14
using double quotes let's copy this
1:16
attribute because I don't feel like
1:17
typing it again the second argument will
1:20
be for a string of
1:22
paper and then
1:26
scissors let's enclose our buttons
1:28
within a div element
1:33
this div element will have an ID of
1:37
choices let's cut our buttons and paste
1:40
them within the div element outside of
1:43
the div element we'll create another div
1:45
element we will display the Player's
1:48
Choice player colon
1:52
space the ID of this development will be
1:56
player display this will display the
1:59
word Rock paper or scissors depending on
2:01
which button we
2:03
pick let's do this for a
2:05
computer text will be
2:08
computer ID computer
2:11
display we should display a result who
2:16
won the ID will be result
2:21
display just for some temporary text I'm
2:23
going to add it's a tie when we style
2:28
this with CSS I would like to be able to
2:30
see the updates we'll get rid of this
2:32
pretty soon eventually we'll add in a
2:35
score tracker but we'll do that after
2:36
our game is at least working okay let's
2:39
head to our CSS
2:40
stylesheet I'm going to zoom back to
2:46
100% let's select the body of our
2:48
document I will set the font family to
2:51
be aiel with the backup of s
2:55
serif let's set the font weight to be
2:57
bold throughout this application
3:02
I will set any margin to be zero around
3:05
the
3:05
body use flex boox to display the
3:08
elements display
3:10
Flex the flex direction will be a
3:16
column and align items
3:22
Center let's select our H1 element I
3:25
need to increase the font
3:27
size font size
3:30
3.5
3:32
RM for a color pick a
3:38
color for me I'll set the lightness to
3:44
20% now we're going to select our
3:46
development of choices actually let's
3:49
make this a class class
3:53
choices select the class of
3:57
choices add margin
4:01
bottom of 30
4:05
pixels within this development we need
4:08
to select all the
4:09
buttons we will select the class of
4:12
choices select all buttons within this
4:15
class we'll increase the font
4:18
size to 7.5 RM these buttons need to be
4:23
big I will set a minimum
4:26
width of 160 pixels
4:30
add a little bit of margin between each
4:34
button zero pixels on the top and bottom
4:37
10 pixels on the sides for the buttons I
4:40
would like rounded Corners I would like
4:42
these buttons to be a
4:43
circle I can set the Border radius to
4:46
something massive like 250 pixels that
4:50
will give us some rounded buttons and
4:52
pick a background color background
4:57
color I want something blue
5:01
I've already pre-picked a color so I'm
5:03
going to use
5:06
this now when I hover my cursor over one
5:09
of the buttons I would like my cursor to
5:12
change into a
5:13
pointer and that does work let's also
5:17
add a transition
5:18
effect let's change the background color
5:22
to e is after half a
5:27
second let's access the hovers class of
5:30
all the buttons of
5:33
choices take the background color I'll
5:36
set the lightness to be 20%
5:38
lighter each button is going to light up
5:41
when you hover your cursor over the
5:42
button then we'll work on the displays
5:45
next we're going to select the player
5:47
display and the computer display these
5:49
are
5:51
ideas player
5:53
display and computer
5:58
display let's set the font size to be
6:01
2.5
6:03
RM and for the result display where it
6:06
says it's a
6:08
tie that's the ID of result
6:12
display set the font
6:15
size to be 5
6:19
RM and I'll add some margin to the top
6:21
and bottom 30 pixels to the top and
6:24
bottom zero on the
6:26
sides okay that is good enough for now
6:30
so we no longer need this placeholder
6:32
for the result display let's add some
6:34
functionality we have a lot of constants
6:36
to declare const choices choices will be
6:40
an array of strings we'll have
6:43
rock
6:45
paper and
6:47
scissors we need to get the player
6:49
display and the computer display so we
6:52
can update them const
6:54
player display equals document. get
7:00
element by ID the ID that I'm selecting
7:04
is player
7:07
display then we have computer
7:12
display computer
7:15
display and result display this one it's
7:19
empty
7:21
currently const result display equals
7:25
document. getet element by ID result
7:28
display
7:31
we'll factor in scoring later we need a
7:33
function of play game that accepts one
7:36
argument the Player's
7:39
Choice
7:41
function play game we have one
7:45
parameter player
7:48
choice when we play a new game we have
7:51
to pick a choice for the computer
7:53
between rock paper or scissors what we
7:55
could do is generate a random number
7:57
between zero and two rock is is index
7:59
zero paper is index one scissors is
8:01
index 2 we'll create a constant within
8:04
play game of computer Choice I'm
8:08
declaring it within the function so we
8:10
can update it every time we play a new
8:12
game equals take our array of
8:17
choices at index for the index we'll
8:21
generate that random number using the
8:23
random method of math math. random
8:26
method * 3 then we need to round it
8:30
because it's not going to be a whole
8:32
number math. floor to round it
8:36
down so the computer's choice will be a
8:39
random index between 0o through two
8:42
which will give us randomly either rock
8:44
paper or scissors hey this is bro from
8:47
the future one thing that would be good
8:48
for us to do is along the way use
8:51
console.log just to be sure that what
8:53
we've been writing has been working so
8:56
within our computer's Choice let's
8:57
console.log whatever that is
9:01
so if this does work after clicking one
9:04
of these buttons the computer is either
9:06
going to pick rock paper or scissors the
9:08
computer picked scissors just now
9:10
scissors scissors it really likes
9:13
scissors apparently so yeah the players
9:15
choice is being populated with the
9:17
string of rock paper or scissors I just
9:19
wanted to confirm
9:21
that and we need a result what are we
9:24
going to display to the
9:26
screen result will be an empty string
9:28
for now first let's check to see if the
9:30
Player's Choice is equal to the
9:32
computer's choice that means it's a
9:35
tie if Player's
9:37
Choice is strictly equal to the
9:40
computer's Choice maybe we both pick
9:43
rock well then we'll take our result to
9:45
be displayed and set it equal to
9:48
be it's a
9:51
tie else somebody is going to
9:54
win let's add an else
9:57
statement we can use a switch
10:00
which we can examine a value against
10:02
matching cases we'll examine the
10:04
Player's
10:07
Choice does the Player's Choice match
10:10
the case of
10:12
rock do these two values match if so
10:17
we'll use the tary
10:20
operator we'll check the condition of if
10:23
our computer's
10:25
choice is strictly equal to scissors
10:32
if so question mark That's the trary
10:35
operator if we pick Rock and the
10:37
computer pick scissors we will return
10:40
you win otherwise if this condition is
10:43
false well that means the computer
10:46
picked paper if our choices already
10:48
don't match and we picked rock that
10:50
means they either picked scissors or
10:52
paper if they didn't pick scissors that
10:54
means they picked paper so they win that
10:57
means we lose
10:59
you
11:00
lose whatever string is returned we're
11:03
going to assign it to result result
11:06
equals whatever is returned either you
11:09
win or you
11:10
lose then we should add a break after
11:12
this
11:15
case all right let's copy this case and
11:18
everything within
11:19
it let's paste it if the Player's Choice
11:23
matches the case of paper and the
11:26
computer's choice is strictly equal to R
11:30
that means if that's true you win else
11:34
you lose let's copy this case and
11:37
everything within
11:41
it case
11:44
scissors if the computer's Choice equals
11:48
paper then you win otherwise you lose
11:52
after we move beyond the IFL statements
11:55
we need to update the text on the screen
11:57
so we will take the players
12:02
display set the text content to equal a
12:08
template string of player colon space
12:12
add a
12:13
placeholder the Player's Choice did we
12:17
pick rock paper or scissors then let's
12:19
do this with the computer's
12:21
Choice select the text content of the
12:24
computer
12:26
display the text will be computer
12:29
computer we will display the variable of
12:33
computer Choice the one that was picked
12:37
randomly and take our result
12:40
display which has no text content
12:44
currently set it equal to be
12:48
result okay let's see what we have
12:50
currently let's pick Rock it's a tie
12:54
paper you win scissors you lose what
12:59
we'll work on next depending on the
13:00
result that's displayed if we win I
13:03
would like the text to be green if we
13:05
lose I want the text to be red going to
13:08
our CSS stylesheet we're going to add
13:10
three
13:12
classes green
13:15
text red
13:18
text pick a font
13:22
color pick something
13:27
green
13:31
and for the red text pick a red font
13:35
color if we win or lose we're going to
13:38
add one of these classes to the class
13:40
list of our result display so going back
13:43
to our Javascript file after we display
13:46
the result now we're going to add a
13:50
switch we're going to examine our
13:54
result we will add a case of you win
14:00
if our value matches this case let's
14:02
take our result display access the class
14:07
list use the add method add the class of
14:12
green
14:13
text then
14:15
break let's copy this
14:18
case paste
14:20
it we will add a case for you
14:25
lose add the class of red text if we
14:29
lose let's see what we have
14:33
currently if we win you get green text
14:37
if you lose you get red text but now if
14:40
it's a tie we have red text with each
14:43
new game we should reset the color back
14:45
to the
14:46
original so before updating the color
14:48
and displaying it let's take our result
14:52
display access the class list use the
14:55
remove method remove any class of green
14:58
test
14:59
text and red
15:01
text let's see if this works you lose
15:06
it's a tie that's black you lose you win
15:10
the color seem to be working all right
15:13
now let's add a scoring mechanism we'll
15:15
have to head back to our HTML
15:17
file after our result
15:20
display we're going to create a Dev
15:23
element the First Development will have
15:25
a class of score
15:30
display the text for the score display
15:32
will be player
15:35
score colon
15:38
space then we'll add a span element
15:41
within with text of zero I will give the
15:45
span element a unique ID of player score
15:51
display the reason I'm putting this
15:53
number within a span element I'm going
15:54
to style this number different from the
15:56
rest of the div element the player score
15:59
okay let's copy this development and
16:01
paste it we need another for computer
16:04
computer
16:07
score the ID of the span element will be
16:09
computer score
16:11
display going back to our CSS stylesheet
16:14
We'll add the following after our result
16:17
display we will select the class of
16:20
score
16:21
display increase the font
16:24
size font size will be 2
16:27
RM
16:29
for the actual numbers I'm going to
16:31
change the color with the CSS property
16:33
where the font color is green I'll add
16:35
an additional selector let's select the
16:38
ID of player score display I would also
16:43
like that to be that shade of green and
16:45
for the red text let's select the ID of
16:50
computer score
16:52
display so the computer score that
16:55
number will be red okay now we just need
16:58
to add functionality to the scoring
17:01
mechanism so back to the
17:03
top we're going to select the ID of
17:07
player score
17:08
display const player score display
17:12
equals document. getet element by
17:15
ID player score
17:18
display and we need the same thing for
17:20
the
17:26
computer computer score
17:31
display and we need a score value a
17:34
number so we can work with it let player
17:38
score equal Z let computer score equal
17:45
0 going to the bottom of this function
17:48
within our switch within our case of U
17:51
win we're going to increment our player
17:53
score player score
17:56
Plus+ then take our player score
18:00
display and update
18:03
it access the text
18:06
content set it equal to whatever the
18:09
player score
18:11
is then let's do this with our
18:15
computer computer score
18:18
Plus+ that's if we
18:20
lose and computer score
18:23
display equals the computer
18:26
score and that should be everything
18:28
thing let's see if this program
18:30
works you lose you win you win it's a
18:36
tie you win you win you lose the player
18:41
score is four the computer score is two
18:44
all right everybody so that is a game of
18:45
rock paper scissors you can make using
18:52
JavaScript
