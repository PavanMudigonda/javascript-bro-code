example 1
0:00
hey again everybody it's me big surprise
0:02
there today I'm going to explain the
0:03
filter method in JavaScript the filter
0:06
method creates a new array by filtering
0:09
out elements in this example we'll
0:11
create an array of
0:13
numbers we will filter out any numbers
0:16
that are odd let's add the numbers 1
0:19
through
0:22
7 now we need a
0:24
function
0:25
function is even we have one parameter
0:29
we have an element that's going to be
0:31
provided to us by the filter method we
0:34
are going to return then write a
0:36
condition we will take our element
0:40
modulus 2 the modulus operator gives you
0:43
the remainder of any division you can
0:45
use modulus 2 to check to see if a
0:47
number is even if this condition is zero
0:50
strictly equal to zero then we will
0:53
return true we will be returning a
0:56
Boolean true or false the filter method
0:59
will will take any values that return
1:01
true and stick them within a new array
1:04
which will effectively filter out any
1:05
elements we don't need that don't return
1:07
true let's see if this works I will
1:09
create a new array even nums equals take
1:14
our original array use the filter method
1:18
pass in a call back is even we will
1:23
display
1:25
console.log our new array even numbers
1:29
and there we are
1:30
2 4 6 let's do this with odd
1:34
numbers function is
1:38
odd take our element modulus 2 is this
1:42
strictly not equal to zero that means
1:46
the number is
1:47
odd let's create a new array let odd
1:51
nums equals our original array numbers
1:56
do use the filter method passing a call
1:58
back is odd let's check out our new
2:02
array odd
2:04
nums there we are we have the numbers 1
2:07
35 7 any numbers that are odd let's go
2:11
over another
2:12
example I will create an array of Ages
example 2
2:15
I'll use const this time instead of let
2:17
const ages Pretend We're teaching a
2:21
college class we might have some
2:23
students still in high school let's say
2:24
a student is 16 another is 17 two are 18
2:30
19 20 and then we have somebody that's
2:33
just a little bit older they're um 60
2:36
we'll use the filter method to filter
2:38
out anybody that is under 18 we will
2:40
find all of the adults we will need a
2:43
function function is adult we have one
2:48
element as a parameter that's going to
2:50
be provided to us we will return a
2:55
condition return check our element is it
2:59
great greater than or equal to
3:02
18 so that's our function let's create a
3:06
new array of adults equals take our
3:10
original array dot use the filter method
3:14
pass in a call back is adult then
3:18
display our new array
3:20
console.log
3:22
adults we have five elements the age of
3:25
the students is 18 18 19 20 and 60 let's
3:30
do this with is children to find anybody
3:33
that's under
3:34
18 is child
3:37
function return element less than 18
3:42
we'll create a new array const children
3:47
equals take our original array use the
3:50
filter method pass in a call back is
3:53
child then display the new array we have
3:57
two students that are children one is 16
4:00
the other is 17 last example we'll
example 3
4:03
create an array of words const
4:07
words add some words I think I'll add
4:10
some fruit I'll add an
4:13
apple
4:15
orange
4:17
banana
4:20
kiwi
4:24
pomegranate and a
4:27
coconut I will filter out any words
4:30
where the length of that word is above
4:32
six so we will create a function
4:35
function get short
4:39
words we have an element as a
4:42
parameter we will return a condition we
4:46
will check if our element access the
4:49
length property of that element they're
4:51
strings so they all have a length
4:53
property how many characters are they
4:55
long that's the length check to see if
4:57
the length of this element is less than
5:00
or equal to
5:01
six if it is return true if not return
5:05
false we will create a new array let's
5:08
call this array short words equals take
5:12
our array use the built-in filter method
5:16
pass in a call back get short words then
5:19
we will console.log the new array short
5:23
words in our array there are four
5:26
elements with the length of the
5:27
characters of each string is six
5:29
surrender Apple orange banana kiwi then
5:33
to finish this off let's get any long
5:35
words we'll create a new
5:37
function get long words check the length
5:41
of the element to see if it's above six
5:45
then we will create a new array const
5:48
long words equals take our original
5:51
array use the filter method pass in a
5:54
call back get long words then we will
5:57
display our new array long words within
6:01
our original array there's two words
6:03
that are considered long pomegranate and
6:05
coconut these words each have more than
6:07
six characters coconut is seven
6:11
pomegranate is 11 all right everybody
6:14
that is the filter method it creates a
6:16
new array by filtering out elements your
6:19
callback is likely going to check in
6:21
condition does each element pass this
6:23
condition and well everybody that is the
6:25
filter method in
6:28
JavaScript
