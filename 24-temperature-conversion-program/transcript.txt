hey what's going on everybody in today's
0:01
video we're going to create a
0:02
temperature conversion program using
0:04
HTML CSS and JavaScript so sit back
0:08
relax and enjoy the show all right let's
0:10
begin everybody we will begin within our
0:12
HTML file make sure you've linked a
0:15
script to your Javascript file which
0:17
we'll fill in later so within the body
0:19
of our document we will create a form
0:22
element within our form we will create
0:25
an H1 heading for the title of this
0:27
program which we will name
0:32
temperature conversion is
0:36
good after our H1 element we'll create
0:39
an input
0:42
element this is a self-closing tag it's
0:44
a text box since we're going to be
0:47
converting temperatures I will set the
0:49
type to be number so that should give us
0:53
some arrows to increase or decrease the
0:55
number or type one in if we need to I'm
0:57
going to give this text box an ID of of
1:02
textbox we'll be referring to this text
1:04
box by its ID later I'm also going to go
1:07
ahead and set an initial value of zero
1:10
then we can increase or decrease the
1:11
number like I said before it is a little
1:14
small but with CSS we will increase the
1:16
size what I'm going to do now is create
1:18
two radio buttons along with
1:21
labels so we have input input is a
1:24
self-closing tag the type will be
1:28
radio and for the
1:31
ID this will be a radio button to
1:33
convert to
1:37
Fahrenheit I can never spell Fahrenheit
1:40
we'll want the radio buttons in the same
1:41
group I will set the name of the group
1:43
to be
1:45
unit oh looks like I misspell type there
1:48
we go so I'm going to place our radio
1:50
button on a new line so within our first
1:53
input element I will add a line break
1:55
all right so after our first radio
1:57
button I'll create a label for it
2:01
label this label will be
2:04
four 2
2:07
Fahrenheit and the text will be Celsius
2:11
to
2:15
Fahrenheit or if you prefer you could
2:17
create like an
2:19
arrow I don't really like the look of
2:21
that let me use an emoji instead so on
2:23
Windows to create an emoji you can hold
2:24
windows and
2:26
semicolon is there an
2:28
arrow
2:30
that'll work so when you click on the
2:32
label you should also be able to select
2:34
the radio button that's because the four
2:36
attribute is the same as the ID
2:38
attribute of the radio button okay let's
2:40
copy both the first radio button and the
2:43
label then paste it but change
2:46
Fahrenheit to
2:48
Celsius let's switch these
2:52
around Fahrenheit to
2:58
Celsius
3:00
to
3:01
Celsius I'm also going to add a line
3:03
break after our first
3:05
label so right
3:07
here as well as here Google wants to
3:11
translate my web page from German to
3:13
English it's probably because of the
3:14
word fahrenheit I'm guessing now I'll
3:16
create a
3:21
button the type will be button the text
3:25
will be submit there is an onclick
3:28
attribute for buttons
3:31
onclick when we click on this button we
3:34
can execute a JavaScript
3:36
function eventually we'll be creating a
3:39
function named convert actually let's
3:41
take care of that now before we forget
3:42
So within our Javascript file function
3:45
convert we'll fill this in
3:48
later so when we click on the button we
3:51
will execute the convert
3:53
function then lastly we're going to
3:56
display a result whatever the new
3:57
temperature is we'll use a paragraph
4:01
element the ID will be result and just
4:06
as a placeholder for now I'm going to
4:08
type select a
4:12
unit all right so far so good let's
4:15
style this program with CSS now be sure
4:17
to save your HTML file we'll move on to
CSS
4:20
CSS we will first change the body of our
4:23
document let's change the font family of
4:25
the body of our document I'll pick aial
4:29
with a backup of son's
4:34
serif I'll change the background color
4:37
too
4:39
background-color I like using hsl
4:42
values let's type a color such as black
4:45
we will change the color to be hsl I'll
4:49
go with a very light gray color like
4:53
95% so the background is going to be
4:56
slightly light gray we'll fill in the
4:58
form section to be Pure White we will
5:01
select our H1 element that's going to be
5:03
the header I'll pick a color again I'll
5:06
be using hsl
5:08
values let's go with I don't know blue
5:11
feel free to pick a different color if
5:13
you would like that's not
5:16
bad then we'll fill in the form our form
5:19
contains pretty much all of these
5:22
elements so let's select our
5:25
form I will change the background color
5:28
I'll just copy this sline and paste
5:30
it but I'll make this Pure
5:35
White I'll text Al line Center
5:37
everything within this
5:39
form so everything should be
5:42
centered I'll set a Max width of the
5:44
form because right now it's taking up
5:46
100% of the width of the web browser so
5:50
max width will be how about 350
5:55
pixels we would like this form to be
5:57
within the middle aligned horizontally
6:00
we can set margin to be
6:03
Auto to automatically Center that I'll
6:06
add a little bit of padding around the
6:08
elements within our
6:10
form
6:11
padding let's do 25
6:15
pixels I'll smooth the corners of the
6:17
form using border
6:18
radius border
6:21
radius 10
6:23
pixels then I'll add a box
6:26
shadow box shadow
6:29
the first value is the horizontal offset
6:33
let's set that to be five
6:35
pixels then the vertical offset I will
6:37
set that to be 5 pixels the third value
6:41
is the blur radius because right now
6:42
it's fairly concentrated let's stick
6:45
with 15 pixels not bad you can also
6:49
select a color again I'm going to use
6:51
hsl
6:52
values you can also change the
6:56
transparency I'll set mine to be 30%
7:00
or approximately
7:01
30%
7:03
0.3 not bad so that's my box Shadow now
7:07
we're going to change the text box so
7:10
this text box does have an ID text box
7:14
let's select this element by its
7:16
ID I'll set the width to be
7:19
50% it's going to take up 50% of the
7:22
width
7:23
available let's text align
7:28
Center the number is going to be right
7:30
in the middle let's change the font
7:33
size let's do 2 em for
7:37
200% I'll add a
7:40
border to pixel
7:44
solid then I'll pick some hsl values for
7:47
the
7:49
color I'll make it a little
7:52
transparent maybe like
7:55
80% let's select a border
7:58
radius
8:00
for pixels to smooth the
8:03
corners I'll add a little bit of margin
8:06
below the text
8:09
box
8:12
margin-bottom 15 pixels is
8:15
good that's going to push the radio
8:17
buttons down further just to give this
8:19
text box more space let's work on the
8:21
radio buttons next so we are selecting
8:24
the
8:26
labels so let's take every label
8:30
I'll change the font size so it's a
8:31
little bigger 1.5 em for
8:35
150% I'll make the font weight to bold
8:38
just to bold
8:40
it there let's select our
8:44
button we are selecting our button I'll
8:47
add a little bit of margin above the
8:49
button margin-top 15
8:53
pixels let's change the background color
8:55
of the button pick a color I'll pick red
8:59
and again I'm going to use hsl values
9:01
because I like
9:05
them Ah that's
9:07
decent I'll change the font size of the
9:09
button 1.5 em for
9:14
150% I'll remove the border border
9:18
none I'll add some
9:22
padding 10 pixels for the top and bottom
9:25
of the button 15 for the
9:27
sides I'll round the the corners with
9:29
border
9:31
radius border radius 5
9:34
pixels I'm going to change the font
9:36
color color
9:40
white then when I hover my cursor over
9:42
the button I will change the cursor to
9:45
be a
9:46
pointer and that appears to work
9:48
now so when I hover over the button I'll
9:51
use the hover pseudo class to change the
9:54
background color of the button we are
9:56
selecting our button then s select the
9:59
hover sudo class we'll make the
10:01
background color just a little bit
10:03
darker we'll change the lightness of our
10:06
hsl value to be like 10% darker so I
10:09
have 60% I'll change that to be 50 so
10:12
now the background should change when I
10:14
hover over the button lastly let's
10:16
change the CSS properties of the
10:19
result so this should have an ID of
10:23
result
10:25
result I'll make the font size a little
10:27
bit bigger font size 1.75 em is
10:32
good and I'll make the font weight bold
10:36
font weight bold all right and that is
10:40
all the CSS we need be sure to save
JavaScript
10:43
everything and then we will move on to
10:45
our Javascript file all right so what I
10:47
like to do is at the top of my
10:49
JavaScript program I will declare all of
10:51
the constants and variables that I'll
10:53
need so let's get our text box I'll set
10:56
this to be a constant const text text
10:59
box equals document. getet element by
11:06
ID the ID that we're selecting is our
11:09
text
11:13
box we'll need the two Fahrenheit radio
11:16
button let's copy this line paste it get
11:20
the ID of two
11:22
Fahrenheit const to Fahrenheit get
11:26
element by ID to Fahrenheit
11:29
then 2
11:31
Celsius 2
11:33
Celsius const 2 Celsius the ID is 2
11:37
Celsius so that will be this radio
11:41
button copy this line paste it then we
11:44
need the result to display the
11:47
result result get element by ID
11:51
result within our HTML file we don't
11:54
necessarily need to select a unit
11:56
anymore We'll add that later if somebody
11:59
presses submit without selecting a radio
12:01
button then we need let temp for the
12:06
temperature when we click on the submit
12:08
button we will execute this function
12:11
convert so what are we going to do
12:13
within this function we'll begin with an
12:15
if statement we'll check to see if our
12:18
two Fahrenheit radio button is selected
12:21
so take two Fen height we'll use the
12:25
checked
12:26
property if this radio button is checked
12:29
it's going to return true if it's not
12:31
it's going to be
12:32
false else if 2 Celsius is
12:38
checked to celsius. checked we'll
12:41
perform some different
12:43
actions else let's change the content of
12:47
our
12:48
result so here result. text content
12:55
equals select a
12:57
unit let's see if this works be sure to
13:00
save
13:01
everything I am not going to select a
13:03
radio button I'm just going to submit
13:06
and that's correct select a unit we
13:07
didn't select one let's be sure that
13:09
these two radio buttons are working just
13:11
temporarily I'm going to change the
13:13
result within the if and else if
13:16
statement you
13:19
selected 2
13:24
Fahrenheit and you selected two Celsius
13:30
I just want to be sure that these radio
13:32
buttons are working so let's convert two
13:34
Fahrenheit submit you selected 2
13:37
Fahrenheit we'll select the second
13:39
radial button you selected 2 Celsius
13:42
okay we know that this program is
13:44
reading these radio button successfully
13:46
so we no longer need these two lines of
13:49
code we're going to get the number from
13:52
our text box we'll store that within
13:54
temp temp for temperature temp equals
13:59
take our text
14:01
box access the value
14:04
within so when we accept user input it's
14:07
of the string data type I'm going to typ
14:10
cast the value as a number so we can use
14:12
it with
14:14
math okay then we're going to take our
14:16
temperature and convert it to Fahrenheit
14:19
here's the formula temp equals
14:22
temp * 9 / 5 + 32
14:29
then we're going to update the text
14:31
content of the
14:33
result result. text content equals our
14:39
temperature then I'm going to add plus
14:42
Fahrenheit so to add the degree symbol
14:45
on Windows you can hold alt then type
14:48
0176 on the
14:50
numpad so this will be
14:52
Fahrenheit let's type 100° CI to
14:57
Fahrenheit that gives us 212° f 10 would
15:01
be 50 1° c would be
15:06
33.8 0 is 32° F if you would like to add
15:11
some Precision following our temperature
15:13
there's a built-in method two
15:17
fixed We'll add one point of precision
15:20
this will give us one digit past the
15:21
decimal place 0° C converted to
15:24
Fahrenheit is 32.0 De
15:27
fah
15:29
10° C is 50° F let's copy these three
15:35
lines then paste them within the else if
15:38
statement we'll keep this line the same
15:41
but we'll change the
15:43
formula temp equals within parentheses
15:47
temp -
15:49
32 * 5 9 then change Fahrenheit to
15:57
Celsius so what is 32° fah converted to
16:01
Celsius that is
16:03
zero 100 is
16:06
37.8 all right everybody so that is a
16:09
simple temperature conversion program
16:11
using JavaScript HTML and
16:16
CSS
