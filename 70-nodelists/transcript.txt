introduction
0:00
so uh yeah I should probably talk about
0:02
node lists today a node list in
0:04
JavaScript is a static collection of
0:06
HTML elements they can be created by
0:09
using query selector all we can select
0:11
Elements by an ID a class or an element
0:14
type node lists are similar to an array
0:17
but they don't have a built-in map
0:18
filter or reduce method they do have a
0:20
for each method at least though an
0:22
important thing to note with node lists
0:24
is that they won't update automatically
0:26
to reflect changes to the Dom for
0:28
example if you were to remove an element
0:30
from the Dom and it's within a node list
0:32
you would also have to separately remove
0:34
that element from the node list so what
setup
0:36
we'll do in this example is create four
0:38
buttons they'll all have the same
0:40
class we'll have button
0:43
one with a class of I don't know what's
0:46
a good name my buttons the class all
0:50
right let's copy this button paste it
0:52
three additional times we'll have button
0:55
two button three button four and I'm
0:58
going to add a little bit of CSS to
1:00
these buttons let's select the class of
1:03
my buttons I'll increase the font size
1:06
so you can see it font size for
1:10
RM add a little bit of margin 10
1:14
pixels remove the border border
1:17
none smooth the corners with border
1:20
radius 5
1:22
pixels add some padding 10 pixels by 15
1:27
pixels I'll change the background color
1:30
to something
1:31
blue background color blue but I'll
1:34
select hsl
1:37
values I'll turn the lightness to like
1:41
60 okay that's decent and the font color
1:44
will be
1:46
white okay that's good enough for now
How to create a nodeList
1:49
one way in which we can create a node
1:51
list is by using query selector all
1:53
we've talked about this in a previous
1:55
video but I'll show you a few more
1:56
advanced things we can do with node
1:58
lists we can select ele Elements by an
2:00
ID a class or an element type we will
2:03
create a node list of let
2:07
buttons equals
2:09
document. query selector
2:13
all let's select all elements by a class
2:16
we need to use dot then the class name
2:19
my
2:20
buttons we could select Elements by an
2:22
element type if I would like to select
2:24
all buttons I would just type in button
2:27
the element type but I would like to
2:29
select only elements by this class now
2:32
that we have our node list I am going to
2:35
console.log my node list of buttons and
2:38
we'll take a look at
2:41
it here's my node list it contains four
2:44
elements button one button two button
2:47
three button four we do have a length
2:50
property a few methods entries for each
2:54
item Keys these are all different
2:57
methods for each is what we're going to
2:59
be using a lot here's how we can change
Add HTML/CSS properties
3:02
the HTML and CSS properties of all
3:04
elements within a node list we can use
3:07
the for each method of a node list and
3:09
iterate through all of the elements so
3:11
we will take our node list of buttons
3:14
use the built-in for each method then
3:16
write an arrow function we are provided
3:19
with an element Arrow do something but
3:22
I'm going to rename element as button
3:25
just so it's more easily understandable
3:27
during each iteration we're provided
3:29
with the current button what would we
3:31
like to do to that button well let's
3:33
change the background color button do
3:37
style background
3:39
color I'll set it to be
3:42
green that should update the color of
3:44
all the buttons not just one of them
3:47
we're iterating through all of the
3:48
buttons within this no list change all
3:51
of their background colors to be green
3:53
let's change the text content too take
3:56
each button access the text content
4:00
I will set it equal to be I don't know
4:02
an emoji or
4:03
something let's do that the text content
4:07
and all the buttons is going to change
4:09
maybe let's aend an emoji not replace
4:12
the text
4:13
content that's better that is how you
4:16
can add and change HTML and CSS
4:18
properties with a node list use the for
4:20
each method then write an arrow function
4:22
to do something in a similar way we're
CLICK event listener
4:25
going to add an event listener to each
4:27
button that will listen for a click so
4:29
again we're going to take our node list
4:31
of buttons use the built-in for each
4:35
method for each button Arrow do
4:39
this we need to add an event listener to
4:41
each button we will take the parameter
4:44
of button add an event
4:48
listener within our event listener we
4:50
have an event
4:51
type and a call back to do
4:55
something the event type is going to be
4:58
click instead of a call back we'll write
5:01
an arrow function we are provided with
5:03
an event Arrow do
5:06
this event is provided to us through the
5:09
web browser when something happens we
5:11
will access the event objects Target
5:14
meaning the button that we click on
5:16
that's going to be our
5:18
Target access the
5:20
style access the background color
5:24
property let's set it to be red or
5:27
better yet tomato because I like
5:29
tomatoes
5:30
each button has an event listener it
5:33
will listen for click events when we
5:35
click on a button the background color
5:37
is going to
5:39
change we're going to add an event
MOUSEOVER + MOUSEOUT event listener
5:41
listener for Mouse over and mouse out
5:44
let's begin with mouse over again take
5:46
our node list of buttons use the for
5:48
each
5:50
method for each button Arrow do this
5:56
take that button add an event listener
6:02
with event listeners we have an event
6:04
type and a call back the event type is
6:08
going to be Mouse
6:10
over when we hover our cursor over
6:13
something what would we like to do we
6:16
will write an arrow function event Arrow
6:19
do this let's access the events Target
6:23
that should equal our button that we
6:25
click on access the style access the
6:28
background color
6:31
so with the current color I'm going to
6:32
go back to my CSS I will copy this color
6:36
paste it but make the lightness 10%
6:40
darker now when we hover over one of the
6:42
buttons the background color is going to
6:45
change I'll set the lightness to like
6:47
40% to make it much more apparent there
6:50
that's better now when I leave one of
6:52
these buttons I need to revert that
6:54
color back to the original really we can
6:56
just copy all this
6:58
code Place Mouse over with mouse
7:01
out and set the background color back to
7:04
the
7:10
original each button now has a mouse
7:12
over and mouse out event
7:16
listener here's how you can add an
Add an element
7:18
element to a node list I will create a
7:21
new button const new button equals
7:26
document. create element
7:29
what element are we creating a
7:33
button so with creating and appending
7:35
HTML elements there's three steps this
7:38
is step one we need to create that
7:40
element
7:43
first step two is to add any necessary
7:46
attributes or css properties so let's
7:49
take our new button change the text
7:53
content of the button equal to be button
7:58
five I would like to give my new button
8:01
a class of my buttons we're going to
8:04
access the class list
8:06
property new button.
8:10
classlist when working with an elements
8:12
class we work with class list not
8:15
class so the class list equals the class
8:19
of my
8:22
buttons then we have step three now we
8:25
have to append this element to the Dom
8:28
what is the parent element of this new
8:29
button going to be well in this case
8:32
it's going to be the body of my
8:34
document we're going to be adding a new
8:36
button right here the parent the
8:38
enclosing element is the body in this
8:40
case access our document select the body
8:44
append Child new
8:48
button and there's button five since we
8:52
added our class of my buttons that's why
8:54
it has all these CSS properties if I
8:56
were to remove this line of code we we
8:59
get the default appearance for a
9:01
button I'll talk more about class lists
9:03
in the next video there's a lot you can
9:04
do with them now if I was to
9:08
console.log my node list of buttons
9:11
here's what we have we have five buttons
9:13
within our Dom but within our node list
9:17
we have four
9:20
buttons button one two 3 4 button five
9:25
isn't within this no
9:27
list node lists are a stat collection
9:30
they won't update automatically to
9:32
reflect changes to the Dom even though
9:34
button 5 is within the Dom we would need
9:37
to manually add it to our node list if
9:39
we want to work with it so to do that we
9:42
can just use Query selector again and
9:44
select all elements by the class so
9:47
let's reassign buttons since we're
9:50
reassigning buttons that's why I
9:51
declared buttons with let instead of
9:53
const so we're able to reassign it
9:55
because if this was a constant we
9:57
couldn't change the elements within it
10:00
so buttons equals
10:03
document. query selector all select all
10:08
elements by a class class my
10:12
buttons and then again let's
10:15
console.log my node list of
10:18
buttons inspect console and there we go
10:23
our node list has five elements button
10:25
one 2 3 four five
10:30
even if you were to add an element to
10:31
the Dom that same element isn't going to
10:34
be automatically added to your node list
10:36
I would recommend using query selector
10:38
all again just to update it here's how
Remove an element
10:40
to remove an element from a node list
10:42
when you click on it we'll have to give
10:44
all of these buttons an event listener
10:46
they will listen for a click event when
10:48
we click on one of these elements remove
10:50
it from the Dom and the node list here's
10:53
how again we will take our node list of
10:56
buttons use the built-in for each method
10:59
for each button within our node list do
11:03
this take each button add an event
11:08
listener we are provided with an event
11:10
type and a call back to a
11:12
function the event type that we're
11:14
listening for is
11:16
click the call back is going to be an
11:19
arrow function we're provided with an
11:21
event Arrow do this to remove an element
11:25
from the Dom when you click on it we
11:27
will access our event object
11:29
access the target use the built-in
11:32
remove method to remove it so let's see
11:35
if this works currently let's remove
11:37
button 2 1 4 3 so those buttons are gone
11:43
but let me show you something I'm going
11:45
to
11:46
console.log my node list of buttons
11:49
after each
11:55
click even if I were to remove these
11:57
buttons from the Dom
12:00
they're still within the node list even
12:02
after all the buttons are gone our node
12:04
list still has four buttons so we do
12:07
have to update that manually here's an
12:09
easy way how to do
12:11
that we're going to use Query selector
12:13
all again we'll reassign
12:16
buttons equals
12:18
document. query selector
12:22
all select all elements from the Dom
12:25
that have a class of my buttons then
12:29
just to see if this works let's
12:31
console.log my node list of
12:38
buttons now when we click on a button it
12:41
should be removed from the Dom and the
12:43
node
12:45
list when I remove all the buttons our
12:48
node list is then
12:49
empty all right everybody so that is an
conclusion
12:51
introduction to node lists they're a
12:54
static collection of HTML elements they
12:57
can be created by using query select all
12:59
we can select Elements by an ID a class
13:02
or an element type they're similar to an
13:04
array but there's no map filter or
13:06
reduce methods and do remember that nod
13:09
list won't update automatically to
13:11
reflect changes to the Dom and well
13:13
everybody that is an introduction to
13:15
node lists in
13:20
