hey what's going on everybody in today's
0:02
video we're going to create a calculator
0:04
program using HTML CSS and JavaScript so
0:07
let's get started all right let's do
0:09
this thing everybody we have a lot of
0:11
buttons to create but we'll need a
0:13
container I will create a div element
0:16
the div element will have an ID of
0:20
calculator within this div element we'll
0:23
create an input
0:25
element the input element will have an
0:27
ID of display
0:30
to display the numbers that we type in I
0:33
don't want somebody to enter in some
0:34
text for the
0:36
display I would like this display to be
0:39
readon I will add the read only property
0:43
so we can't type in anything even though
0:45
I'm trying I will create a nested
0:49
development that has an ID of keys for
0:52
all of the keys we need to add a lot of
0:55
buttons we'll begin with the first I
0:57
will create a button element
1:00
the text on the button will be plus I
1:03
will set the onclick attribute of this
1:07
button to be a JavaScript function we
1:09
still need to Define this function
1:11
eventually we'll create a append to
1:16
display
1:17
function we have one argument to pass
1:19
into this JavaScript function a
1:22
character of
1:24
plus that's our first button let's copy
1:27
this button and paste 13 additional
1:31
times if I counted
1:39
right okay the second button will be
1:41
seven the character we're passing in is
1:45
seven followed by
1:47
8
1:50
9
1:53
minus
1:55
4
1:57
5
1:58
6
2:01
asterisk for
2:04
multiplication
2:06
1
2:07
2
2:10
three forward slash for
2:13
division then
2:17
zero and here are the new buttons I'm
2:20
Mis counted we need to add one
2:22
more a DOT for a
2:25
decimal now we need an equals button
2:27
we're going to arrange that a little
2:29
different let's create a
2:31
button with the text of
2:34
equals the onclick attribute of this
2:37
specific button is going to be
2:42
calculate then we need a button to clear
2:45
our
2:48
screen the text on this button will be
2:50
capital c for clear the on click
2:54
attribute of this button is going to be
2:57
clear display
3:00
and that is all the buttons we'll
3:02
need so let's save everything and let's
3:06
go to our CSS
3:07
stylesheet I'm going to zoom back to
CSS
3:11
100% first let's style all these buttons
3:14
I will select all
3:16
buttons for each button I will set the
3:19
width to be 100
3:22
pixels the height to be 100 pixels so
3:26
they're
3:26
even I would like rounded buttons I will
3:30
set the Border radius property to be 50
3:34
pixels so they're
3:36
circles let's remove the
3:39
border border
3:42
none I'll change the background color of
3:44
the buttons
3:48
background-color I'll use hsl values
3:51
I'll set the lightness to be 30% so
3:54
they're
3:54
darker for the text of the button I will
3:57
set the color to be white
4:00
for the font
4:02
size I will set that to be three
4:07
RM set the font weight to be
4:12
bold then when I hover my cursor over
4:14
one of the buttons I would like my
4:16
cursor to be a
4:18
pointer
4:20
cursor
4:23
pointer now we have to arrange these
4:25
buttons
4:26
properly let's select the ID of keys
4:31
keys is a development that's containing
4:33
all of the
4:34
buttons this
4:36
element all of the buttons are
4:40
within to arrange these buttons in a
4:42
grid we can set the display
4:45
property to be a
4:48
grid for this calculator I would like
4:51
four columns to do that I will set the
4:55
grid template columns property to be
5:01
we'll use the repeat function of CSS I
5:04
would like four columns then to arrange
5:07
these buttons evenly you can use 1
5:10
F FR stands for fractional unit 1 FR
5:15
indicates that each column should take
5:17
up an even amount of space so now we
5:20
have Columns of four if I were to set
5:22
this to three we would have Columns of
5:24
three but I'm going to use Columns of
5:26
four because I would like all of the
5:28
operators on the left hand side
5:30
I'll set the Gap to be 10
5:35
pixels that is the gap between each of
5:38
the
5:38
rows then I'll add some
5:40
padding of 25
5:44
pixels that's padding around the
5:46
keys let's select the ID of
5:49
calculator I'll add that to the top to
5:52
keep everything
5:54
organized with our calculator I will
5:57
select a font family
6:00
of Ariel with a backup of s
6:04
serif let's pick a background color for
6:07
the
6:08
calculator I will select something
6:12
darker I'll set the lightness to be
6:16
15% I'll round the corners of the
6:20
calculator border radius 15
6:26
pixels the corners of the calculator are
6:28
smooth now
6:30
then I will set a Max width of the
6:33
calculator to be 500
6:36
pixels if any elements overflow I will
6:39
set that to be
6:41
hidden this is mostly for our display if
6:44
we have a very long equation all right
6:47
next let's select the display right now
6:49
it's kind of
6:51
small we are selecting our ID of
6:55
display let's set the width to be 100%
7:02
I'll add some padding of 20
7:05
pixels for the text of the display I
7:07
will set the font size to
7:10
be 5
7:14
RM let's text a line
7:20
left I'll remove the border border
7:25
none and I'll change the background
7:27
color I'll just copy this property
7:29
because I'm lazy let's increase the
7:31
lightness to
7:36
20% then we'll select the body of our
7:43
document I will remove all margin margin
7:48
zero I would like the calculator to be
7:50
in the middle of my window right now
7:52
it's in the top left corner if you would
7:54
prefer it up here you can leave it as
7:57
is I will set the display to be Flex for
8:01
Flex
8:03
box
8:04
justify content in the center for a
8:09
horizontal alignment for a vertical
8:12
alignment we can set
8:15
align items to be Center but we do need
8:19
to increase the height of the body of
8:20
the document so it's
8:23
100% I will set the height to be 100 VH
8:27
for 100% the viewport height that should
8:31
place the calculator in the middle of
8:32
the body of our document both
8:34
horizontally and vertically for the
8:37
background color I'm going to decrease
8:39
the lightness
8:40
slightly for the background color I will
8:43
set the lightness to be like
8:46
95% okay let's go to the bottom of our
8:49
CSS
8:50
stylesheet when I hover over one of
8:52
these buttons I would like to increase
8:54
the lightness so with all
8:58
buttons
8:59
with the hover sudo
9:01
class change the background color so the
9:05
lightness is 40% instead of
9:08
30 now these buttons light up when we
9:10
hover our cursor over one of the
9:13
buttons now when I click on one of the
9:15
buttons I'll increase the lightness
9:17
further so it
9:18
flashes we are selecting the active
9:21
studo class
9:22
now let's take our background color
9:25
property increase the lightness to 50%
9:29
when we hover over a button it lights up
9:31
when we click on it it flashes
9:35
momentarily so with all of these
9:38
operators I would like all of these
9:39
operator buttons to be a different color
9:41
I'll pick orange we're going to give
9:43
each of these buttons a new class let's
9:46
head back to our HTML file beginning
9:49
with the plus button I will set the
9:52
class equal
9:54
to operator Das BTN for button
9:59
so let's copy this class paste it for
10:03
our minus
10:04
button multiply
10:06
button divide button and the clear
10:13
button now we will select the class of
10:17
operator BTN for
10:20
button let's change the background
10:24
color I'm going to set the background
10:26
color to be
10:28
orange
10:30
I've already pre-picked a
10:34
color when I hover my cursor over one of
10:37
the operator buttons I would like the
10:39
color to be a lighter orange instead of
10:42
gray let's take our operator button
10:46
access the hover sudo class I'll
10:48
increase the lightness to
10:53
65% then when I click on one of these
10:56
buttons I would like the lightness to
10:57
increase further
10:59
with the operator button
11:01
class with the active pseudo class
11:04
increase the lightness to
11:07
75% so when I click on one of the
11:09
operator buttons it's going to flash
11:12
momentarily all right and that is all
11:14
the HTML and CSS that we need now we
11:17
just need to add functionality let's go
11:19
to our Javascript
11:20
file for our Javascript file there's not
JavaScript
11:23
a lot we have to write first we need to
11:25
get the display element so what was that
11:28
ID
11:31
display const display equals document.
11:36
getet element by ID get the ID of
11:42
display we have three functions to
11:45
create a function for append to display
11:48
calculate and clear display these three
11:52
functions function append
11:57
to display
12:00
there is one parameter
12:03
input because we were passing in a
12:05
character when we call this
12:07
function then we have a
12:09
function to clear
12:14
display then a function to
12:22
calculate we'll begin with a pen to
12:24
display all we're going to do is take
12:26
our display this element access its
12:30
value append it with plus equals our
12:35
input and let's see if this works seven
12:40
I forgot to change the font color of the
12:42
display so let's do that within our
12:44
display element let's set the color to
12:47
be white okay that's much
12:51
better
12:56
7.13 + 5
12:59
equals okay we know that that works when
13:03
I click on the clear button I would like
13:04
to clear this
13:06
display let's access our display element
13:09
access the value property set it equal
13:12
to an empty string
13:17
3.14159 when I hit clear it should clear
13:20
the
13:21
display lastly we have
13:23
calculate let's take our display
13:26
elements value property set it equal to
13:30
now we're going to use the eval
13:33
function the eval function takes an
13:35
expression such as 1 + 2 + 3 and
13:39
evaluates it and gives a result it's
13:41
kind of like it's its own built-in
13:43
calculator so to say evaluate the value
13:47
within our
13:48
display display.
13:51
value so if I add
13:55
3.14 plus 1
14:00
01 I'm given a result of
14:03
4.15 now for some reason if we get an
14:05
error for example 7 +
14:09
equals well we have a problem let's go
14:12
to our
14:13
console we've encountered an uncaught
14:16
syntax error because we never finished
14:18
our equation in the last lesson we
14:20
learned about error handling this is
14:23
dangerous code it can cause an error
14:26
let's surround this code with a tri
14:27
block
14:29
we will try this code and catch any
14:32
errors that
14:34
happen so we need a catch block now
14:37
catch any
14:39
errors we will change the value of the
14:42
display to equal some text of
14:48
error all right and that should work
14:53
3.14 times equals that results in an
14:57
error we clear it and then start over
15:02
what's 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 that would be 10
15:08
all right everybody so that is a
15:09
calculator program you can make using
15:12
JavaScript HTML and CSS impress your
15:18
friends
