0:01
video I'm going to give you an
0:02
introduction to key events in JavaScript
0:05
so sit back relax and enjoy the show so
0:09
what we've discussed in the previous
0:10
topic is event listeners an event
0:12
listener can be added to an HTML element
0:15
they will listen for specific events to
0:17
create interactive web pages we'll be
0:20
discussing key down and key up there is
0:22
a third type of key event called key
0:25
press however according to the official
0:27
documentation this event is incompatible
0:30
with all web browsers so you should
0:31
avoid using key press a key down event
0:34
occurs when you press down on a key a
0:36
key up event occurs when you release a
0:38
key by adding an event listener to the
0:40
Dom document we can detect when we press
0:43
down or release a key here's how we will
0:46
access our Dom then add an event
0:49
listener add event
0:52
listener we have two arguments the event
0:55
type and a call back when we press down
0:58
on a key let's do something
1:01
doesn't matter what key it is any key
1:03
for this next argument I can either pass
1:05
in a call back an anonymous function or
1:07
an arrow function I like Arrow functions
1:09
so I'm going to use an arrow function
1:11
we're provided with an event parameter
1:13
when something happens within our web
1:15
browser an event object is created we
1:18
can access it so I'm going to
1:21
console.log this event object and we'll
1:23
see the details of it be sure to select
1:25
your web browser I'm going to press the
1:28
q key
1:30
then let's go to
1:31
inspect
1:33
console and here's that
1:36
event the web browser provided us with a
1:39
keyboard
1:40
event the key pressed was Q there's a
1:44
relevant key code of 81 and there's
1:46
other properties too like was the ALT
1:49
key being held down at the time it
1:51
wasn't same thing with the shift key and
1:53
the target which is the body of our
1:56
document I'm going to Output the key
1:59
prop property of the event we'll press a
2:02
different
2:05
key I'm going to hold down the F
2:07
key I'm not releasing it I'm holding it
2:10
down we're going to consistently fire
2:13
key down
2:14
events I would like to detect when I
2:16
release a key I will use the key up
2:18
event so let's copy this paste it the
2:21
event is going to be key up I'll display
2:25
something else I'm going to use a
2:27
template
2:27
string I will display key down equals
2:32
then I will display this events key
2:35
let's do this with key up too I'll just
2:38
copy
2:39
this key up equals event.
2:43
key let's go back to our
2:46
console I'm going to hold down the S
2:49
key then when I release it we'll have a
2:53
key up event key up equals
2:56
s oh one more important thing the arrow
3:00
keys we have Arrow up arrow down arrow
3:04
left and arrow right if you ever would
3:07
like to make some sort of game the arrow
3:09
keys are also accessible now what we'll
3:12
do on key down and key up is change an
3:14
HTML element so to make this simple
3:17
within our HTML document I'm going to
3:19
create a div element this div element
3:21
will have an ID of my box I'll add some
3:25
text an
3:28
emoji all right all right let's add a
3:30
little bit of
3:31
CSS we will select my
3:35
box I will set the background
3:38
color to be light blue we haven't picked
3:41
light blue
3:43
yet I will set a width of 200
3:47
pixels a height of 200
3:50
pixels a font
3:52
size of 7.5
3:56
RM I'll use flex box display Flex
4:01
justify content
4:06
Center aine item
4:11
Center this part is important for the
4:13
next exercise we are going to set the
4:15
position to
4:18
relative for relative positioning I'll
4:21
set the body of my document to have no
4:23
margin margin zero all right we are
4:28
ready we are going to select the ID of
4:31
my
4:32
box const my box equals document. getet
4:38
element by ID the ID that I'm going to
4:41
select is my
4:45
box when I press a key down I'm going to
4:49
change the text content of my box mybox
4:53
do text content equals I'll pick a
4:56
different
4:57
Emoji let's do that one
5:00
and I'll change the
5:02
CSS my box.
5:05
style do background color equals
5:10
tomato or some other color of you're
5:13
choosing so when I press down on any key
5:16
the HTML and CSS is going to change I'm
5:19
going to release that key but we don't
5:21
revert back to normal our HTML element
5:24
stays that way what we'll do is that
5:25
when we release a key we'll revert these
5:27
changes by going back to the origin
5:30
so let's take my box change the text
5:34
content to equal an emoji because I like
5:38
emojis we'll use the original
5:40
one then I will set the background color
5:43
to be light
5:45
blue now if I were to hold down a button
5:48
the HTML and CSS is going to change
5:51
until I release that button which I am
5:53
about to now in 3 2 1 go I'm going to
5:58
try and press the space bars fast fast
5:59
as I can seizure
6:01
warning let's
6:04
go okay it's about time we move on what
6:07
we're going to do now is using the arrow
6:09
keys move this element we're going to
6:12
create a const of move amount when
6:16
pressing an arrow key how far do we want
6:18
to move this element let's say 10 for 10
6:22
pixels I will create a variable for X
6:25
think of these as coordinates I will set
6:27
that to be zero and y y will also be
6:31
zero X for any horizontal movement and Y
6:35
for any vertical movement document.
6:39
addevent
6:41
listener when we have a key down event I
6:45
would like to do something I'll write an
6:47
arrow function we're provided with an
6:49
event do all this code I only want to do
6:52
something if a user uses an arrow key so
6:56
if I was to console.log my event
7:00
then access the key property let's go to
7:03
inspect console select your document I
7:07
would like to do something only if the
7:09
key pressed is Arrow up arrow down arrow
7:12
left or Arrow right I don't want any of
7:14
the other keys I can write this if
7:18
statement if access our event access its
7:23
key follow this with the starts with
7:26
method does this key start with arrow
7:31
we'll only enter the SI statement if the
7:34
key of the event is Arrow up arrow down
7:36
arrow left or Arrow right then we'll
7:39
write a switch we haven't written any
7:41
switches for a while we will examine the
7:45
key of our event with switches we
7:48
examine a value against matching cases
7:52
if we have a case of Arrow
7:55
up if the key of our event matches the
7:58
case of of Arrow up then do this we'll
8:02
take our
8:03
y-coordinate subtract our movement
8:05
amount which is
8:06
10 Yus equals the movement amount and
8:11
then be sure to break to break out of
8:13
the switch then we need a case for arrow
8:18
down arrow
8:21
down y + equals our movement amount
8:25
Arrow
8:28
left
8:31
Arrow
8:32
left X for the horizontal axis minus
8:36
equals the movement
8:38
amount and then Arrow
8:41
right arrow
8:44
right X plus equals the movement
8:48
amount then outside of the switch but
8:50
within our if statement we're going to
8:53
access my
8:55
box access the
8:57
style access the top property set it
9:00
equal to a template
9:03
string we're going to take our variable
9:05
of Y for the y coordinate then add
9:09
pixels take the top property of my box
9:12
set it equal to the y-coordinate we're
9:15
going to copy this and do this with the
9:17
left
9:18
property set it equal to X in pixels be
9:23
sure to select the body of your document
9:25
we can move right with the right arrow
9:27
key down
9:32
left and
9:34
up or diagonal if I hit two keys at
9:39
once the arrow keys have a default
9:41
Behavior to scroll you can see that if
9:43
we go down too far we have a scroll bar
9:45
on the right hand
9:46
side we can prevent the default behavior
9:49
of a key we just have to add this line
9:51
of code take our event then follow it
9:54
with the prevent default method
9:59
so when my element Scrolls off
10:02
screen it'll disappear we're not going
10:04
to scroll with
10:08
it to increase the distance in which
10:10
this element moves we can increase the
10:12
move amount let's set it to be 100 now
10:15
we're moving a lot further with each key
10:19
press hey this is bro from the future
10:22
there's one more thing I would like to
10:23
add to this project when pressing down
10:25
on a key let's change the text content
10:27
and the background color much like what
10:29
we did with the first exercise then when
10:32
we release a key we'll revert the HTML
10:34
and the CSS back to normal we're
10:36
combining the first exercise and the
10:38
second one and this is the result when I
10:40
move the arrow keys this guy is going to
10:42
freak out until I Let
10:48
Go pretty exciting all right everybody
10:51
so that is an introduction to key events
10:53
in JavaScript you're going to add an
10:55
event listener to the document when you
10:58
select your document and press a key
11:00
when the key is pressed down that will
11:02
create a key down event when you release
11:04
a key that creates a key up event and
11:07
well everybody that is an introduction
11:09
to key events in
11:14
JavaScript
