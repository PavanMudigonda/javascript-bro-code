introduction
0:00
yo what's going on people so today I got
0:02
to explain Dom navigation in JavaScript
0:05
Dom navigation is the process of
0:07
navigating through the structure of an
0:09
HTML document using JavaScript HTML
0:13
elements include but are not limited to
0:16
the following properties for Dom
0:17
navigation we can get the first child
0:20
the last child the next sibling the
0:21
previous sibling a parent or all the
0:24
children of an element so for this
0:26
exercise within our HTML document we're
0:29
going to create a few unordered lists of
0:31
course these unordered lists are going
0:33
to be for food because I like food the
0:36
first unordered list will have an ID of
0:39
fruits let's create a few list item
0:42
elements an
0:45
apple an
0:47
orange and a
0:51
banana we'll need a few unordered lists
0:53
to work with let's copy this unordered
0:56
list and paste it twice the second list
0:59
will be for
1:01
vegetables pick some vegetables I'll
1:04
pick
1:05
carrots
1:07
onions
1:09
potatoes the third unordered list will
1:12
be for
1:14
desserts I'll pick
1:17
cake
1:19
pie ice
1:22
cream that is good enough for now
firstElementChild
1:25
heading back to our Javascript file I
1:27
will now discuss the property of first
1:30
element child our unordered lists are
1:33
elements they each have their own
1:35
children a child element is any element
1:38
found within this element our unordered
1:41
list of fruits has three children Apple
1:45
orange banana vegetables has three
1:48
children carrots onions potatoes
1:50
desserts has three children as well cake
1:53
pie and ice cream let's say that our
1:55
unordered list of fruits is a parent
1:58
well Apple which would be the firstborn
2:01
orange would be the middle child and
2:03
banana would be the last born if these
2:05
were actual children so think of it that
2:08
way so I'm going to create a constant of
2:11
element I'll be using this as a
2:14
reference document. getet element by ID
2:18
I will get that unordered list of
2:21
fruits I'm storing this unordered list
2:24
within this
2:26
element I will create a reference for
2:28
the first child equals take our element
2:33
access the first element
2:37
child if I was to take this element
2:40
change its style access its background
2:44
color set it to be
2:47
yellow which element is going to be
2:50
highlighted Apple if I selected a
2:53
different element like my ID of
2:55
vegetables the first child would be
2:58
carrots then dessert
3:00
s the first element child of desserts is
3:04
cake they are the firstborn children
3:07
they're at the top Within These
3:09
unordered lists if you used query
3:11
selector all I'll give you a
3:13
demonstration I will select all
3:16
unordered lists const UL
3:20
elements equals
3:23
document do query selector all select
3:29
all unordered
3:32
lists this will return a node list node
3:35
lists do have their own built-in for
3:37
each method take all UL elements use the
3:41
built-in for each method what do we want
3:44
to do iterate over every unordered list
3:49
element do this let's create a reference
3:53
to the first
3:56
child equals take our unordered list
4:02
element access its first element child
4:07
then store it as a
4:08
reference let's take our first
4:11
child access its style access its
4:15
background color property set it to be
4:20
yellow that will highlight all of the
4:22
first element children of all the
4:25
unordered lists so that's how you can
4:27
use Query selector all to select all of
4:30
the first children of all matching
4:32
elements now we're going to access last
lastElementChild
4:35
element child with our unordered lists
4:38
if we're selecting our elements of
4:40
fruits vegetables and desserts this
4:43
would return the last child banana
4:46
potatoes or ice cream depending on what
4:48
we're selecting if these were actual
4:50
children these three elements are the
4:53
last born they're the youngest I'm going
4:56
to create a reference to an element
4:59
equals access the Dom get element by ID
5:04
I will get my ID of
5:07
fruits I will create a reference to the
5:10
last child
5:13
equals take our
5:15
element get the last element
5:20
child take our last child
5:24
element access its style access its
5:27
background color set it to
5:30
yellow so that will highlight banana if
5:34
I change the selected element to
5:37
vegetables that would select
5:39
potatoes if I selected desserts that
5:42
would select ice cream they are the last
5:45
element children found within each of
5:48
these elements if I were to use Query
5:50
selector all to select all unordered
5:52
lists let's create const UL
5:56
elements equals document do query
6:02
selector all select all unordered
6:06
elements this returns a node list they
6:10
have their own built-in for each
6:12
method take our node list of unordered
6:15
elements use the built-in for each
6:18
method take each unordered list
6:22
element use an arrow function to do this
6:25
I will create a reference to the last
6:28
child
6:30
equals take each unordered list element
6:34
access the last element
6:37
child take the last child during each
6:41
iteration access its style access its
6:44
background color set it to be yellow and
6:47
that will select banana potatoes and ice
6:51
cream select all unordered lists take
6:54
each of their last children change the
6:57
background color to be yellow so that is
6:59
the last element child property in this
nextElementSibling
7:02
next example I'll demonstrate next
7:05
element sibling but we're going to make
7:07
a few changes going back to our HTML
7:09
file we will give each of these list
7:11
items a unique ID so let's start with
7:14
the first the ID will be Apple for the
7:17
first list item element I'll copy this
7:19
ID for each of these elements and then
7:22
change them in a
7:27
moment so we have apple followed by
7:29
orange banana carrots onions potatoes
7:35
cake pie then ice
7:40
cream if I'm selecting my unordered list
7:43
of fruits Apple orange banana or the
7:45
children they are all siblings to each
7:48
other if I were to select Apple then get
7:50
the next sibling that would be orange if
7:53
I select carrots the next sibling would
7:55
be onions if I selected cake the next
7:58
sibling would be pie
8:00
so let's create a
8:01
constant of element equals document.
8:06
getet element by ID the ID that I'm
8:09
going to select is
8:12
Apple I will create a reference to the
8:14
next sibling equals take our element
8:19
access its next element
8:23
sibling take our next
8:26
sibling access its Style access its
8:29
background
8:31
color set it to be
8:34
yellow if I'm selecting Apple the next
8:37
sibling to that would be orange if I
8:39
were to select orange the next sibling
8:42
would be banana if I were to select
8:44
banana well banana doesn't have a next
8:46
sibling it's the last in line we
8:49
wouldn't be selecting anything there is
8:51
no next sibling for banana if I were to
8:54
select carrots the next sibling is
8:56
onions if I selected onions the next
8:59
sibling is potatoes if I selected cake
9:02
the next sibling is pie if I selected
9:05
pie the next sibling is ice cream what
9:08
if I selected fruits vegetables or
9:10
desserts what would be highlighted I
9:13
will select the ID of fruits that would
9:17
highlight my unordered list of
9:19
fruits these three unordered lists of
9:22
fruits vegetables and desserts they're
9:24
all children of the body they're all
9:28
siblings to one another
9:30
it's kind of like if the list item
9:32
elements of Apple through ice cream are
9:34
all children the unordered lists of
9:36
fruits vegetables and desserts are the
9:38
parents and the body is the grandparent
9:41
if I select the unordered list of fruits
9:44
the next sibling would be
9:46
vegetables by accessing the next element
9:49
sibling of my unordered list of fruits
9:52
that selects my unordered list of
9:55
vegetables if I selected vegetables then
9:58
get its next sibling that would give me
10:00
this unordered list of
10:02
desserts all right then we have previous
previousElementSibling
10:05
element sibling if I select an element
10:08
we'll get the previous element sibling
10:10
so if I were to select orange that would
10:12
give me Apple if I selected banana that
10:15
would give me orange if I selected
10:16
onions that would give me carrots I will
10:19
create a constant for element equals
10:23
document. getet element by ID I will
10:27
select Orange
10:31
const prev meaning previous sibling
10:35
equals take our element access the
10:39
previous element sibling if I were to
10:43
take my previous sibling access its
10:46
style access its background color set it
10:49
to be
10:51
yellow the previous sibling of orange is
10:54
Apple the previous sibling of banana is
10:58
orange
11:00
if I selected onions the previous
11:02
sibling is
11:04
carrots the previous sibling of
11:09
potatoes is
11:11
onions the previous sibling of pie is
11:14
cake the previous sibling of ice
11:18
cream is
11:19
pi if I selected the first sibling then
11:22
attempt to get the previous
11:26
sibling well we don't select anything
11:28
the previous sibling of a first child
11:30
doesn't exist if I selected the previous
11:33
sibling of my unordered list of
11:37
vegetables that would select my
11:39
unordered list of fruits if I selected
11:43
the unordered list of desserts that
11:46
would give me
parentElement
11:48
vegetables now we have the parent
11:50
element property whichever element I
11:52
select we'll get the parent the parent
11:55
is the element that contains it
11:59
const element equals document. getet
12:05
element by ID I will select
12:10
Apple const
12:12
parent equals access our
12:15
element access the parent element let's
12:21
take our parent access its style access
12:24
its background color set it to be yellow
12:28
that will highlight
12:29
my unordered list of fruits if I
12:32
selected orange well that wouldn't
12:34
change the parent is still fruits same
12:37
thing goes with
12:38
banana if I selected carrots well the
12:41
parent is vegetables that unordered list
12:45
if I selected ice cream well the parent
12:48
is
12:49
desserts so that's how to get the parent
12:51
of an element you can access the parent
12:54
element
children
12:55
property the last property we'll discuss
12:57
is children we we can return all of the
13:00
children of a selected element I will
13:03
create a const element equals
13:06
document. getet element by
13:09
ID I will select my ID of
13:12
roots I would like all children of this
13:15
element I'll create a reference to
13:18
Children equals take our element access
13:22
the children property if I was to
13:26
console.log
13:27
children this is what we're working
13:31
with by accessing the children of an
13:33
element that returns an HTML
13:36
collection this HTML collection has
13:39
three list item
13:41
elements HTML collections don't have a
13:43
built-in for each method I would need to
13:46
typ cast it as an array using the from
13:48
method of arrays let's take all of our
13:51
children convert it to an array then
13:54
method chain the for each
13:57
method let's let's take each child from
14:02
children then do this take each child
14:05
during each iteration access its style
14:08
access its background color set it to be
14:13
yellow so this will highlight all
14:15
children of a selected element Apple
14:19
orange then banana if I selected
14:23
vegetables that would highlight carrots
14:25
onions
14:27
potatoes if I select
14:29
desserts that would highlight cake pie
14:32
then ice cream you can even access these
14:34
children by an index
14:39
number let's say you would like to
14:41
highlight a middle sibling orange onions
14:44
or pie let's take our children it's an
14:47
HTML collection access it by an index
14:50
number so let's access children at index
14:53
one of desserts that would highlight
14:56
Pi let's select vegetables
14:59
that would highlight onions then fruits
15:02
would highlight
15:03
orange all right everybody so that is an
conclusion
15:06
introduction to Dom navigation it's the
15:08
process of navigating through the
15:10
structure of an HTML document using
15:12
JavaScript there are several different
15:14
properties that you can use to navigate
15:16
through HTML elements and well everybody
15:19
that is an introduction to Dom
15:20
navigation in
15:25
JavaScript
