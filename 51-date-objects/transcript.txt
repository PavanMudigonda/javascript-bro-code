current date
0:00
what's up everybody so in today's video
0:02
I'm going to explain date objects in
0:04
JavaScript date objects are objects that
0:07
contain values that represent dates and
0:09
times these date objects can be changed
0:12
and formatted to suit our needs here's
0:14
an example we will create a date object
0:17
that contains the current date and time
0:20
to do so let's create a constant named
0:22
date date will be an object we will call
0:25
the date Constructor with the new
0:27
keyword date then C in no arguments for
0:31
the current date and time so I'm going
0:33
to
0:35
console.log my date object which gives
0:38
me my current date and time as of right
0:41
now I'm filming this video on a Thursday
0:43
November 9th the year 2023 at about 7:
0:47
in the morning so depending on when
0:49
you're watching this video the date and
0:51
time is going to be different if you
datetime arguments
0:53
would like to create your own custom
0:54
date and time object you'll have to pass
0:56
in some arguments you can follow this
0:58
order for the date Constructor
1:00
the first argument corresponds to a year
1:03
then month day hour minute second and
1:06
milliseconds even so for the year let's
1:08
say
1:09
2024 the month zero corresponds to
1:13
January one is February then that means
1:16
a month of 11 is December let's say
1:19
January so that will be zero for the day
1:22
one for the 1 for the hour uh 2 2 in the
1:26
morning this isn't military time by the
1:28
way for the minute 3 minutes after the
1:30
hour for the seconds 4 seconds after the
1:34
minute we can even add milliseconds if
1:36
we would like so for the milliseconds
1:38
let's say five and here's my new date
1:41
object Monday January 1st 2024 about 2:
1:45
in the morning passing in a string
datetime strings
1:48
representation of time to the date
1:49
Constructor is also valid let's say the
1:52
year is
1:53
2024 January 2nd for the time you're
1:56
going to type t for
1:58
time 12 12 noon then add Z for UTC time
2:04
and there's my new date again Tuesday
2:06
January 2nd 2024 6:00 in the morning
milliseconds since epoch
2:10
another format you can use is within the
2:12
date Constructor pass in a given amount
2:14
of time in Mill seconds since epic if I
2:17
could describe epic I would describe it
2:19
as when the date your computer thinks
2:21
time began if you were to pass in zero
2:23
to the date Constructor you'll be given
2:26
a date and time around December 31st 196
2:29
9 So within the DAT Constructor you can
2:32
pass in a given amount of milliseconds
2:35
since this date so if I was to pass in
2:38
1.7 billion
2:45
milliseconds what I'm telling the day
2:47
Constructor is give me the date and time
2:50
that's 1.7 billion milliseconds since
2:53
that epic date when I pass in 1.7
2:57
billion milliseconds the date that I'm
2:59
given is Tuesday November 14th 2023
3:03
about 400 p.m. passing in milliseconds
3:05
would be good for some sort of timer now
get methods
3:08
let's use the current date and time I
3:10
will pass in no arguments you can
3:12
extract individual values from a date
3:14
object I would like the year const year
3:18
equals take our date object I will use
3:21
the get full year method to get the year
3:25
then I will
3:28
console.log the year and this will be a
3:30
number
3:32
2023 let's get the
3:35
month const month equals our date object
3:40
use the built-in get month method then I
3:44
will
3:45
console.log the
3:47
month currently for me it's November not
3:50
October so remember January is zero
3:53
December is 11 let's get the day const
3:59
day equals date get date not day if you
4:04
get the day that will give you the day
4:06
of the week like Sunday Monday Tuesday
4:08
that sort of thing let's
4:11
console.log the
4:13
day so for me it's the
4:15
9th let's get the hour const hour equals
4:21
date get hours
4:24
plural
4:26
console.log the
4:28
hour for me at 7:00 in the
4:31
morning let's get
4:33
minutes const minutes equals get
4:40
minutes console.log the
4:44
minutes it is 7:45 in the
4:48
morning get
4:53
seconds get
4:58
seconds
5:00
console.log the
5:02
seconds so
5:04
745 21 seconds after the minute now if
5:08
you need the day of the week here's what
5:10
you can do const day of week equals date
5:16
get day that will give you the day of
5:19
the
5:20
week
5:22
console.log day of week for me that is
5:25
for Sunday is zero Monday is one so that
5:29
means it is Thursday now with a date
set methods
5:32
object you can even set the date with a
5:34
method let's
5:37
console.log the
5:41
date I'm going to set the Year date set
5:46
full year I will set the year to be
5:50
2024 yep Saturday November 9th
5:53
2024 let's set the
5:56
month set month
6:00
I will set the month to be January so I
6:02
will pass in zero Tuesday January 9th
6:07
let's set the
6:09
day that would be with set date not day
6:13
I will set it to be the 1 January
6:17
1 the hours with set
6:20
hours let's go with two for 2: in the
6:24
morning set
6:27
minutes 3 minutes P the
6:31
hour set
6:35
seconds 4 seconds past the minute you
compare datetime
6:39
can even compare dates as well let's
6:42
create two date objects const date one
6:45
equals a new date I'll pass in a string
6:48
representation of a date we won't
6:50
include the time though for the year
6:52
let's say
6:54
2023 December that would be 12 31st New
6:58
Year's Eve basically
7:00
and for date
7:02
2 let's say date 2 is New Year's Day
7:06
2024 January
7:10
1st using an if statement let's compare
7:13
to see if date 2 is greater than date
7:19
1 if it is then let's
7:23
console.log happy New
7:26
Year so date 2 is greater than date 1
7:30
will print happy New Year let's change
7:33
date two to be
7:35
2023 December
7:38
30th well nothing happens then but
7:41
that's to be
7:42
expected all right everybody so those
conclusion
7:44
are date objects they're objects that
7:47
contain values that represent dates and
7:49
times these date objects can be changed
7:51
and formatted to suit our needs and well
7:54
everybody those are date objects in
7:58
