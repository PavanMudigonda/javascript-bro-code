example 1
0:00
Hey so uh what's going on everybody
0:02
today I gotta explain if statements so
0:04
in JavaScript if a condition of our
0:06
choosing is true we can execute some
0:09
code if it's not true we can do
0:12
something else that's how to put it
0:13
simply for example let's say we have a
0:16
user's age let age equals 25.
0:22
to write a if statement we can type if a
0:24
set of parentheses then a set of curly
0:26
braces within the set of parentheses we
0:29
can check a condition let's check to see
0:31
if
0:32
our age variable is greater than or
0:36
equal to 18. if this condition is true
0:39
we can execute whatever code is within
0:42
the set of curly braces if this
0:44
condition is true let's
0:46
console.log a message
0:49
you are old enough to enter this site
0:56
my age is 25 this condition is true we
0:59
will execute this code within the curly
1:00
braces you are old enough to enter this
1:04
site what if my age was 13.
1:08
well if this condition is true we don't
1:11
do this we don't execute it we skip over
1:14
it if you would rather take a different
1:16
course of action if you would rather do
1:19
something else you can write an else
1:21
clause
1:23
if this is not true we will do
1:26
whatever's within the else Clause let's
1:28
display a different message
1:31
you
1:32
must be 18 plus 2
1:36
enter this site my age is 13.
1:41
we will end up displaying you must be 18
1:44
plus to enter this site basically
1:46
speaking if this condition is true do
1:49
this else if not do this instead
1:54
it's kind of like a fork in the road
1:55
which path are we gonna take here's
example 2
1:58
another example let's say we have
2:00
variable time time will be in hours in
2:04
military time
2:05
if our time is 9 as in 9 am
2:10
let's write a if statement
2:13
if time
2:15
is less than 12 as in noon
2:19
then console
2:21
DOT log
2:25
good morning
2:28
else if it's after 12 that means it's at
2:31
least the afternoon
2:33
console.log
2:37
good afternoon
2:41
the time is nine as in nine a.m good
2:44
morning
2:45
what if our time was 14 like 1400 in
2:49
military time well then we will display
2:51
good afternoon
booleans
2:54
conditions also work very well with
2:56
Boolean variables
2:58
let's create a Boolean variable is
3:02
student
3:04
if you're a student say true if not then
3:07
false
3:08
now with the Boolean variable if you
3:10
need to check the value with an if
3:12
statement
3:14
you can just place the Boolean variable
3:16
within the condition itself
3:19
the condition either evaluates to be
3:21
true or false
3:23
if is student is true then console.log
3:31
Ura student
3:34
else
3:36
console.log
3:40
you are not a student
3:44
is student equals false
3:47
we will execute the else Clause you are
3:50
not a student If This Were true
3:53
we'll execute the if Clause you are a
3:56
student
nested if AD
3:58
you can even create nested if statements
4:01
this time we will have two variables let
4:04
age equals some age
4:06
and let has license as in a driver's
4:10
license
4:11
that's how to spell license
4:14
has license will either be true or false
4:18
so in the United States you need to be
4:20
at least 16 years old to have your
4:23
license
4:24
we'll check that first
4:27
if age is greater than or equal to 16
4:32
Plus console.log
4:36
you are old enough to drive
4:42
else
4:44
console.log
4:50
you must be 16 plus to have a
4:56
license
4:58
if I changed my age to 15
5:03
well I'm not old enough to have a
5:05
license at least in the United States it
5:08
might vary depending on your country let
5:10
me know in the comments section how old
5:11
you have to be to get a driver's license
5:13
I'm kind of curious
5:15
you can use another if statement within
5:17
an if statement after we check to see if
5:19
somebody is old enough to have a license
5:21
let's check to see if they do have a
5:23
license or not
5:25
so I will add another if statement
5:27
within our if statement pay attention to
5:30
the indentation
5:32
if
5:34
has license
5:37
since we're checking a Boolean variable
5:39
that is going to be the condition itself
5:42
it evaluates to be true or false
5:45
if has license console.log
5:50
you
5:51
have
5:53
your license
5:56
else again pay attention to the
5:58
indentation
6:00
console.log
6:04
you do not have your license yet my age
6:10
is 15 I don't have a license this is the
6:13
result
6:15
you must be 16 plus to have your license
6:18
since this condition is false we skip
6:21
over everything within curly braces
6:23
entirely
6:24
if I set my age to be 18
6:28
you are old enough to drive but I don't
6:30
have a license that's set to false
6:33
you do not have your license yet
6:35
so we execute this condition so we enter
6:38
anything within this set of curly braces
6:40
we display this message then check the
6:43
sift statement my condition is false
6:46
then we will execute the else clause
6:49
if I set has license to be true
6:53
well then you are old enough to drive
6:55
you have your license
6:57
all right now I need to discuss else if
6:59
statements
else if
7:01
we will keep our age variable
7:03
we have our if statement
7:06
if age is greater than or equal to 18
7:09
then we will console.log
7:14
you are old enough to enter this site
7:21
else
7:23
console.log
7:26
you must be 18 plus to enter this site
7:32
my age is 18 I can enter the site if my
7:36
age was 12 I can't enter the site
7:39
if there's any other conditions you want
7:41
to check before reaching your else
7:43
statement you can add an else if clause
7:47
then you can check another condition
7:49
let's check to see if somebody's age
7:52
is less than zero your age can't be
7:55
below zero let's let the user know
7:58
console.log
8:00
your age can't be
8:04
below zero
8:06
I will set my age to be negative one
8:10
that's not possible
8:12
your age can't be below zero
8:15
since this condition is false we skip
8:17
over this Clause then move on to the
8:19
next condition else if this condition is
8:22
true execute this clause which it was
8:25
then it's not necessary to go to the
8:28
else statement because we already
8:29
executed one of these Clauses you can
8:31
add as many else if statements as you
8:33
would like let's add another
8:35
else if
8:37
let's check to see if somebody is over
8:39
100 years old
8:42
age is greater than or equal to 100.
8:47
console.log
8:51
you are too old to enter this site
8:57
okay now pay attention to this it's
8:59
really important my age will be 101.
9:04
you are old enough to enter this site
9:07
so why didn't we execute this Clause our
9:10
age is greater than or equal to 100 the
9:13
order of our Clauses does matter we
9:16
start at the top and work our way down
9:18
and check all the conditions on the way
9:19
down so with our first statement this if
9:22
statement age is greater than or equal
9:25
to 18 101 is greater than or equal to
9:28
18. we will execute this clause and skip
9:31
over everything else that comes after
9:33
even though this response is more
9:35
appropriate for what we're looking for
9:37
we still skip over it even though this
9:39
is true because we executed this one
9:41
first so I would recommend that we move
9:44
this Clause to the beginning and change
9:47
it to an if statement
9:48
first let's check to see if age is
9:51
greater than or equal to 100
9:53
else if age is greater than or equal to
9:56
18 so this should work as intended
9:59
our age is 101 you are too old to enter
10:03
the site
10:05
let's add another else if Clause so to
comparison operator
10:08
check to see if two values are equal you
10:10
gotta use the comparison operator which
10:12
is two equal signs
10:13
let me give you a demonstration
10:16
else if
10:18
let's check to see if somebody's age is
10:22
directly equal to zero
10:24
so be sure you're using two equal signs
10:26
for a comparison not one one equal sign
10:29
is the assignment operator
10:31
you want two equal signs to see if two
10:33
values are equal
10:35
if somebody's age is exactly zero
10:38
will display a custom message
10:41
you can't enter you were just born if
10:47
somebody's age is zero they're a baby or
10:50
an infant
10:51
so let's set our age to be zero
10:55
you can't enter you were just born
10:58
this condition is false we skip this
11:00
Clause this condition was true we
11:03
execute this clause and Skip everything
11:05
else that comes after using all this
project
11:07
code let's work on an exercise we're
11:09
going to create a text box and a button
11:11
so somebody can submit their age then
11:13
depending on what they enter we will
11:15
display a message so within our HTML
11:17
file we'll create a few things
11:20
let's create a label
11:22
the text on the label will be enter your
11:25
age
11:27
let's add a break after
11:30
then a text box
11:32
the label will be input the type will be
11:35
text
11:37
the ID will be my text
11:42
I'll add a break
11:44
we'll create a submit button
11:47
button
11:48
type equals submit
11:52
the ID will be my submit
11:56
the text on the button will be submit
12:01
I will also create a paragraph element
12:04
the ID
12:06
let's say is result
12:09
element to display a result
12:12
all right that is everything we'll need
12:14
so we can't see the paragraph element
12:16
quite yet the text content of the result
12:19
element will be one of these lines of
12:21
text
12:22
so let's go back to our index file
12:25
we'll create our elements I will set
12:27
them to be constants
12:29
const
12:31
my text
12:34
equals document dot get element by ID
12:40
the ID is going to be my text
12:45
and const
12:47
my submit that's the submit button
12:50
document.getelementbyid
12:53
the ID is going to be my submit
12:57
then lastly
13:00
result element
13:02
const
13:03
result element equals
13:07
document.getelementbyid the ID is result
13:09
element
13:11
let's scoot these if statements down
13:13
when I click on the button we will
13:15
execute a function
13:17
the button is named my submit
13:21
my submit dot on click attribute equals
13:25
a function
13:26
when we click on the button what are we
13:28
going to do
13:29
let's take all of our if else if and
13:31
else clauses
13:33
cut them
13:34
then paste them within the function for
13:37
the button
13:38
when we click on the button then we will
13:40
check our age
13:42
let's set this variable to be undefined
13:45
then we will get our age from the text
13:47
box
13:48
H equals
13:51
my text Dot value get the value from the
13:55
text box
13:57
and assign it to age but remember when
13:59
we get text from a text box it's a
14:01
string data type we need to Typecast it
14:04
to a number so we will set age to equal
14:08
then use the number function to convert
14:11
it to a number
14:12
then we can check our age
14:14
we'll replace console.log with the text
14:17
content of the result element result
14:20
element dot text content equals our
14:25
message
14:26
I'll use a template literal so I'll use
14:28
backticks
14:30
let's copy our text paste it within the
14:33
template literal then I will delete the
14:36
console.log message
14:38
so we'll just follow this pattern result
14:40
element dot text content equals our
14:44
message
15:10
all right let's see if this works
15:13
so we will type in our age let's say I'm
15:15
25 press submit
15:17
and we have one problem let's see what's
15:19
going on
15:21
oops okay so I forgot to add a set of
15:23
parentheses after the function
15:25
let's add that
15:27
let's say I'm 25 press submit you are
15:30
old enough to enter this site
15:32
let's say I'm 12 you must be 18 plus to
15:35
enter the site what if I'm 101
15:38
you are too old to enter the site what
15:40
if I'm zero
15:41
you can't enter you were just born
15:44
I'm negative one
15:47
your age can't be below zero all right
15:49
everybody so that is everything you need
15:51
to know to get started working with if
15:53
statements in JavaScript
