what's up people so today I got to
0:01
explain Constructors in JavaScript a
0:04
Constructor is a special method for
0:06
defining the properties and methods of
0:09
objects in Prior videos we've
0:11
constructed objects like this we would
0:13
declare an object assign it some
0:15
properties and some methods you know
0:17
this works but what if we have to create
0:19
a lot of objects here I'm manually
0:21
creating three different car objects
0:23
that can be a lot of work what we could
0:25
do instead is use a Constructor to
0:28
construct these objects automatically Al
0:30
all we have to do to construct these
0:32
objects is pass in some unique data to
0:34
the Constructor to construct these
0:36
objects here's an example we are going
0:38
to create a function
0:41
car do pay attention to the
0:45
capitalization we'll need to set up some
0:47
parameters what sorts of properties will
0:49
we accept when we construct a car object
0:52
how about a make model year and
0:57
color these are arguments we'll receive
0:59
when we construct a car object to assign
1:02
these properties we're going to use the
1:04
this keyword doake equals the make that
1:09
we
1:09
receive let's do this with model this do
1:13
model equals the model we
1:16
receive this doe equals year this do
1:22
color equals color that's good enough
1:25
for now our car Constructor is a
1:28
reusable method where we can define the
1:30
properties and methods of objects we
1:32
create to use this Constructor I will
1:34
create an instance of an
1:36
object I will use const car one will be
1:39
our first object equals we'll need to
1:42
use the new keyword type the name of the
1:45
Constructor car car is a special method
1:48
we'll need to pass in some arguments
1:50
we'll need a make model year and color
1:53
in that order my first car feel free to
1:56
send some different data to the
1:57
Constructor but for me my first car will
1:59
be be a
2:01
Ford make sure each value is comma
2:04
separated Mustang the year will be
2:08
2024 and the color will be
2:11
red we should now have a car object with
2:14
the name of car 1 and I'm going to
2:18
console.log car 1's properties car 1.
2:22
make Ford let's do this with the other
2:25
properties we have
2:26
model
2:28
Mustang
2:31
year
2:34
2024 and color red now this method is
2:39
reusable we can reuse it to create other
2:41
car
2:42
objects let's create const Car 2 equals
2:48
new car we'll pass in different data
2:50
this time the make will be chevr
2:55
a I will pick a
2:58
Camaro the year
3:00
2025 and the color will be blue now I
3:04
can display car 2's
3:06
properties let's Select Car 2. make car
3:09
2. model car 2. year car
3:11
2.cor we have a Chevy Camaro year 2025
3:15
the color is blue let's create one more
3:18
car same process as before const car 3
3:23
equals new
3:26
car I'll go with a Dodge
3:30
charger the year
3:33
2026 and the color will be
3:37
silver let's access car 3's properties
3:40
car 3. make car 3. model car 3. year car
3:44
3.or Dodge Charger 2026 the color is
3:48
silver another thing with these
3:49
parameters too you can name these
3:51
parameters anything when we assign these
3:53
properties it can be kind of confusing
3:56
like this. make equals make really we
3:58
write our Constructors this way just for
4:00
readability technically this would work
4:02
if we renamed our parameters for example
4:04
make will be parameter a model will be B
4:07
year is C color is D then be sure to
4:10
change these when we assign them A B C D
4:16
this would still work however this
4:18
Constructor isn't as readable like what
4:20
the heck is a b c and d it would be good
4:23
practice to clearly Define our
4:25
parameters for readability purposes all
4:28
right now let's add a method
4:30
we'll take this.
4:33
Drive equals a
4:39
function we
4:42
console.log I'll use a template string
4:46
you drive the I'll add a
4:49
placeholder
4:51
this.
4:53
model with Cars 1 through three let's
4:56
use the drive method car 1. drive
5:01
you drive the
5:04
Mustang car 2. drive you drive the
5:07
Camaro and K 3.
5:10
drive you drive the charger all right
5:13
everybody so that's a Constructor it's a
5:15
special method for defining the
5:17
properties and methods of objects it
5:19
helps with code reusability we can reuse
5:21
it to create many objects instead of
5:23
having to type them all out manually and
5:25
well everybody those are Constructors in
5:28
JavaScript
