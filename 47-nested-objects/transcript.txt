example 1
0:00
so uh yeah we're doing a thing today
0:02
today I got to explain nested objects in
0:04
JavaScript nested objects are objects
0:07
inside of other objects they allow you
0:09
to represent more complex data
0:11
structures a child object is enclosed by
0:15
a parent object by using nested objects
0:17
we have the capability of creating some
0:19
very complex data structures for example
0:22
a person object could contain an address
0:25
object as well as a contact info object
0:28
or a shopping cart object each item in
0:30
your shopping cart is an individual
0:32
object such as a keyboard a mouse or a
0:34
monitor each of these child objects
0:37
would have their own properties and
0:38
methods for example a price a name
0:41
specifications on the item a shipping
0:44
method nested objects are just objects
0:46
inside of other objects let me give you
0:48
a basic example we'll create a person
0:51
object const person equals an object we
0:55
need a set of curly braces a person
0:57
might have a full name property
1:00
I will set that to be SpongeBob in this
1:02
example SpongeBob
1:06
SquarePants and age of
1:09
30 is SpongeBob a student is student
1:14
he's in boating school so let's say
1:15
that's true objects can also contain
1:18
arrays we'll create an array of
1:20
hobbies to declare an array you need to
1:23
set a straight brackets what sorts of
1:25
hobbies does SpongeBob have he knows
1:28
karate he does
1:32
jellyfishing I need one more uh let's
1:35
say that he enjoys
1:38
cooking now we're going to create a
1:40
nested object this person object will
1:43
have an address
1:45
object so we need a set of curly braces
1:49
a few of the properties of the inner
1:51
address object could be a street
1:54
SpongeBob has an address of 124 con
1:58
Street
2:00
his City will be bikini
2:04
bottom and a country we won't do a full
2:07
address but I think this is good enough
2:09
for this example so SpongeBob lives in
2:11
the ocean let's say that his country is
2:13
international waters I'll just
2:16
abbreviate International our person
2:18
object has a nested address object
2:21
inside of it taxes some of these
2:23
properties of our person
2:24
object we would type the name of the
2:27
object use the property accessor which
2:29
is dot then the name of the property
2:32
full name SpongeBob
2:35
SquarePants let's print his
2:39
age
2:41
30 is SpongeBob a student that is true
2:45
I'm going to display the array of
2:48
hobbies person. Hobbies this will give
2:51
you an array but if you need individual
2:54
elements you have to list an index
2:56
number so Hobbies at index zero would be
2:58
karate
3:00
one is
3:01
jellyfishing index two is cooking let's
3:06
console.log our person
3:09
object dot the address
3:13
object this would return an entire
3:15
object if you need one of the properties
3:18
within this object that's within the
3:20
person object you would have to follow
3:22
the inner object with the property
3:24
accessor again that dot person. address.
3:28
Street which would give you 124 con
3:33
Street the city person. address. city
3:36
Bikini
3:37
Bottom person. address. country
3:41
international waters so when accessing a
3:44
property within a nested object you have
3:46
to use the property accessor twice that
3:49
dot if you would like to Loop through
3:51
the properties of a nested object you
3:53
can write a for Loop like
3:56
this
3:57
for const
4:00
property in person.
4:05
address
4:08
console.log take our person object
4:11
access the nested object address then
4:14
use the index of operator the straight
4:17
brackets give me the current
4:21
property and there we are all right
example 2
4:24
let's make something a little more
4:25
complicated we're going to create a
4:27
class that utilizes objects so we will
4:31
begin with
4:32
class
4:35
address our class will have a
4:39
Constructor for an address we need these
4:42
three things feel free to add more if
4:44
you would like a street City and
4:51
Country then we'll assign these
4:53
properties this. Street equals
4:56
Street this. City equals
5:01
City this. Country equals
5:06
country now we'll create a person
5:09
class class
5:12
person our person class will also have a
5:18
Constructor we'll need a name age and an
5:22
address for the address I'm going to use
5:25
rest
5:26
parameters we can pass in different
5:28
parts of an ADD address and store it
5:30
within an array when we create a person
5:32
object we will assign this.name equals
5:36
name this. AG equals age now for the
5:40
address we're going to construct an
5:42
address
5:43
object this. address equals a new
5:48
address we're going to call the
5:50
Constructor of our address class and
5:53
pass in our
5:54
address I'm going to utilize the spread
5:57
operator to spread our address
6:01
we'll send our address object a street
6:04
City and
6:05
Country all right let's construct some
6:07
of these person
6:08
objects const person one equals a new
6:13
person this will call the Constructor
6:15
but we have to pass in arguments to
6:17
match the
6:18
parameters a name we'll just do a first
6:20
name to keep it short and age SpongeBob
6:23
will be 30 we also need an address a
6:27
street City and Country
6:32
124 con
6:34
Street City will be Bikini
6:38
Bottom his country will be international
6:44
waters and just for readability I'm
6:46
going to put the address on a new
6:51
line let's create person
6:56
two person two will be Patrick
7:00
Patrick age
7:03
37 Patrick will live on 128 con Street
7:08
you'll have the same city and the same
7:10
country then let's make person
7:16
three person three will be
7:20
Squidward age
7:23
45 Squidward will live on 126 con Street
7:31
all right let's see if this all
7:33
worked
7:35
console.log let's start with person one
7:38
person one. name which is
7:41
SpongeBob age 30 let's get his
7:44
address address and this returns an
7:47
object which is good that's what we
7:49
wanted we have a nested object an
7:51
address object for some of the
7:53
properties within that address object we
7:55
have a street City and Country we use
7:58
the property accessor again
7:59
of dot give me the street 124 con Street
8:05
the city bikini bottom and the
8:08
country international waters all right
8:11
let's confirm this with person three
8:13
just to be sure it all works person
8:15
three give me the name
8:19
Squidward age
8:22
45 address gives me an object we'll use
8:25
the property accessor again give me the
8:28
street
8:30
126 con Street the city bikini
8:34
bottom and the country international
8:37
waters this will also all work for
8:40
person two if it worked with person one
8:42
and three all right everybody so those
8:44
are nested objects they're objects
8:46
inside of other objects they allow you
8:48
to represent more complex data
8:51
structures a child object is enclosed by
8:54
a parent object in this example our
8:57
address is the child object of the
9:00
person object we're creating a new
9:02
object within our person object and well
9:06
everybody those are nested objects in
9:12
