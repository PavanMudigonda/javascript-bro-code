hey what's going on people so in today's
0:01
video I'm going to explain the time
0:03
method of console the time method is a
0:05
tool that allows you to measure the time
0:07
it takes for a section of code or
0:10
process to execute it's great for
0:12
identifying performance bottlenecks to
0:14
start the time method you'll want to
0:16
pass in a label this will be a unique
0:18
identifier to stop keeping track of time
0:20
you can follow the time method with the
0:23
time end method then pass in that same
0:25
label that unique identifier by using a
0:28
combination of these two methods you can
0:30
to see how long some process takes for
0:32
example I will create a for Loop that's
0:35
going to Loop 1 million times let I
0:39
equals z continue this as long as I is
0:43
less than 1
0:46
million then i++ it doesn't really
0:49
matter what we do here do some code here
0:53
we're just going to Loop a million times
0:55
so I can see how long this process takes
0:58
wherever I would like to start this
1:00
timer I will use
1:03
console.time I will want to pass in some
1:05
sort of label some unique identifier
1:07
let's say test wherever I would like to
1:10
stop the timer I will again use console
1:14
but instead use the time end method and
1:17
pass in that same
1:19
label within our console it's going to
1:21
show us how long this process is going
1:23
to take between when we start and when
1:25
we end to get from here to here it took
1:29
0 9 milliseconds if I were to increase
1:32
the amount of iterations this time is
1:34
going to go up for me to Loop 10 million
1:37
times that took 3.8 milliseconds 100
1:40
million is 34 milliseconds let's try a
1:45
billion 338
1:48
milliseconds using the time method could
1:50
be useful within a function we will
1:53
create a function to load some
1:56
data we're just going to pretend to load
1:58
some data but don't actually do it again
2:01
I will use a for loop we're just
2:04
pretending to load data let I equal Z
2:08
we'll iterate this Loop like a billion
2:12
times then
2:15
i++ pretend to load some data if I would
2:20
like to measure how long this function
2:22
takes in order to identify any
2:24
bottlenecks I will use the time method
2:26
of console
2:28
console.time I'll need a unique label
2:32
I'll use the name of the function within
2:33
quotes as a unique
2:35
identifier then when this function ends
2:38
I will follow this with the time and
2:41
method of console and pass in that same
2:45
label then we'll need to execute this
2:48
function let's pretend that our program
2:50
is running really slow for some reason I
2:53
can test each part of my program one
2:55
function at a time let's see how long
2:58
the loaded data function takes
3:00
338 milliseconds that could be a little
3:03
or a lot depending on what you're doing
3:06
but here we're just pretending to load
3:07
some
3:08
data let's create a function to process
3:11
some data function process
3:17
data we are just going to pretend to
3:20
process some
3:22
data let I equals
3:25
z let's Loop through I 1 million times
3:30
then
3:33
i++ pretend to process some data if I
3:38
would like to measure how long this
3:40
function takes I will use
3:43
console.time pass in a unique
3:45
label for example the function name as a
3:49
string then we will end this timer
3:53
console.time and pass in that same label
3:58
then we will execute this function
4:01
all right let's see how long these
4:02
functions
4:03
take if I'm looking at both of these
4:06
functions and trying to identify any
4:08
bottlenecks it looks like the load data
4:10
function is taking a lot longer than the
4:12
process data function in our make belief
4:15
scenario we've noticed that our load
4:17
data function is taken quite a bit of
4:18
time that's where the time method could
4:20
be helpful all right everybody that is
4:22
the time method it's a tool that allows
4:25
you to measure the time it takes for a
4:27
section of code or process to execute
4:29
it's great for identifying performance
4:31
bottlenecks and well everybody that is
4:33
the time method in
4:38
