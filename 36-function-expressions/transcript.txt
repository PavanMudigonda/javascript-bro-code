hey everyone so today I'm going to
0:01
explain function expressions in
0:03
JavaScript a function expression is a
0:05
way to define functions as a value or a
0:09
variable not to be confused with
0:11
function declarations where you define a
0:13
block of reusable code that performs a
0:15
specific task we're already familiar
0:17
with function declarations such as this
0:21
function then you create a function name
0:23
such as hello in this example let's
0:27
console.log the word
0:30
hello with the function expression we
0:32
can assign a function to a variable or
0:35
pass it as a value to another function
0:37
so this time we're going to write a
0:39
function expression I will create a
0:41
constant named
0:43
hello equals a function parentheses
0:47
curly braces we'll do the same thing we
0:50
will console.log hello and if I were to
0:54
run this the identifier hello has
0:56
already been declared so for now I'm
0:58
just going to remove this function
1:00
declaration all we're doing is assigning
1:02
a function to a variable to use the
1:04
function that's stored within we have to
1:06
take our variable name and add a set of
1:08
parentheses to invoke it kind of like
1:10
it's a pair of telephones talking to
1:12
each other hello using JavaScript we
1:15
also have the capability of passing a
1:17
function as a value I will introduce the
1:21
set timeout function there's going to be
1:25
two parameters a call back to a function
1:29
and an of time we're going to wait then
1:31
execute this function this will be in
1:34
milliseconds 3,000 milliseconds
1:36
translates to 3 seconds let me put this
1:39
function back after 3,000 milliseconds I
1:43
will execute the hello
1:45
function 1 2 3 hello instead of using a
1:51
function declaration we are going to
1:53
pass a function expression as an
1:55
argument to the set timeout function
1:57
instead of a call back we will create a
1:59
fun function we will pass an entire
2:02
function as an argument what are we
2:04
going to do we will after 3 seconds
2:08
console.log the word hello and let's see
2:12
if this works just to prove that I'm not
2:14
a
2:15
liar 1 2 3 hello in JavaScript it is
2:21
legal to pass an entire function as an
2:23
argument or treat it as a value we'll
2:27
use previous examples of the map filter
2:29
anded methods of arrays I will create an
2:32
array const
2:35
numbers equals the numbers 1 through six
2:38
1 2 3 4 5
2:41
6 I would like to square each of these
2:44
numbers what we've done in a previous
2:46
lesson is declare a function function
2:50
Square we had one parameter in that
2:52
example we had an
2:54
element what we did is we
2:57
returned math. poop
3:00
to raise a base to a given power we're
3:03
raising our element to the power of two
3:06
the map method will return a new
3:09
array const squares
3:13
equals
3:15
numbers map we're passing in a
3:18
callback to
3:20
square then
3:23
console. log
3:26
squares this works we are using a
3:29
function
3:30
declaration but this time we will now
3:32
use a function
3:34
expression we will treat this function
3:36
as a value let's cut this
3:39
function replace the call
3:42
back then paste it within the map method
3:45
then we just need to remove the name we
3:47
don't need a name and this is still
3:49
going to
3:51
work yeah it still does we don't
3:54
necessarily need to think of a function
3:56
name one of the benefits of doing this
3:58
is that we're not polluting the global
3:59
name space with function names we're
4:01
only going to be using this function
4:03
once there's no need to declare a
4:04
function let's create a function
4:06
expression to cube these numbers now as
4:09
a beginner it might be helpful to write
4:10
out your functions as a declaration
4:12
first then transform it into a function
4:15
expression function
4:18
Cube we have our element as a
4:21
parameter I'm going to copy this return
4:25
math.pow element to the power of three
4:29
we will create a new array const cubes
4:34
equals
4:36
numbers. map we don't need to pass in a
4:39
call back we will cut this entire
4:42
function paste it within the map method
4:45
then we don't need the
4:46
name then console.log cubes there are
4:50
all the original numbers cubed all right
4:53
I think we're starting to get the hang
4:54
of this let's quickly use the filter
4:56
method to filter out any even or odd
4:59
numbers
5:00
I will create const even nums equals
5:04
take our array numbers we will use the
5:07
filter
5:08
method then we will pass a function
5:11
expression as an
5:13
argument there's one parameter an
5:17
element we are going to
5:19
return element modulus 2 to see if it's
5:23
divisible by
5:24
0 is the result strictly equal to 0o let
5:29
let's see if this works console.log even
5:32
nums there they are we have 2
5:35
46 let's do this with odd
5:38
numbers odd nums use the filter method
5:42
again all we're going to change is
5:45
strictly not equal to
5:47
zero return any odd
5:49
numbers
5:51
135 then lastly reduce we will sum all
5:54
of the elements of this
5:58
array con
6:00
total equals our
6:03
numbers do
6:06
reduce passing a function
6:10
expression we have two parameters an
6:14
accumulator and an
6:16
element we will
6:18
return
6:20
accumulator plus our
6:23
element return the
6:25
total which is
6:27
21 we already do have some practice with
6:30
map filter and reduce instead of using
6:33
function declarations then passing a
6:34
call back we can pass an entire function
6:37
expression as an argument to these
6:39
methods in the next topic I'll discuss
6:41
Arrow functions which shortens the
6:43
syntax even further you'll like Arrow
6:45
functions all right everybody so those
6:47
are function Expressions they are a way
6:50
to define functions as a value or a
6:52
variable we've both defined a function
6:55
expression as a variable we stored that
6:57
within this hello variable we've also
6:59
also passed entire functions as an
7:01
argument which you can do with
7:02
JavaScript there's a few benefits of
7:04
function Expressions one of which is you
7:06
don't need to keep on thinking of
7:08
function names you can perform a
7:09
function once then just forget about it
7:11
they're also used in callbacks and
7:14
asynchronous operations higher order
7:16
functions closures and event listeners
7:18
these are topics we still need to
7:20
discuss but we will be using function
7:22
Expressions a lot don't worry we will
7:24
have more practice and well everybody
7:26
those are function expressions in
7:28
JavaScript
