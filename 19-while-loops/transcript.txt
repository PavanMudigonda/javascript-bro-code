hey what's going on everybody so today
0:01
I'm going to explain why Loops in
0:03
JavaScript a while loop will repeat some
0:06
code while some condition is true take
0:09
this program for example we have a
0:12
variable username if our username is
0:15
equal to an empty string then we will
0:18
console.log you didn't enter your name
0:20
else console.log hello username if I run
0:24
this program then check within our
0:26
console well we didn't enter our
0:29
username now if I were to change this
0:31
program to a while loop
0:33
while our username is equal to an empty
0:36
string repeat this line of code Forever
0:38
Until this condition is no longer true
0:41
then when we escape the while loop we
0:44
can print the message hello username
0:46
this is what happens when I run the
0:48
program
0:50
we just print this line of code Forever
0:53
and my computer is probably going to
0:54
crash
0:58
I can't seem to stop
1:01
help okay I think it broke a while loop
1:04
will continue some code infinitely while
1:07
this condition is true
1:09
if it no longer is true then we can
1:11
escape the while loop if I were to set
1:14
my username to be something other than
1:16
an empty string
1:19
well we never actually enter the while
1:21
loop we skip over it entirely and go
1:24
straight to console.log at the end
1:27
so what we do first is check the
1:29
condition if it's true then we get
1:31
sucked into the while loop and execute
1:33
this forever you usually want some sort
1:36
of way to exit the while loop while
1:37
you're in it otherwise you get what is
1:39
known as an infinite Loop so let's
1:41
rewrite this program
1:44
let username equal an empty string while
1:47
our username is strictly equal to an
1:50
empty string
1:51
let's ask the user to enter in their
1:54
name username equals I'll use a window
1:57
prompt
2:03
enter your name
2:06
okay let's try this again
2:08
enter your name I'll press ok
2:10
we can't seem to close this window until
2:13
we type in something
2:14
you can see I'm clicking on okay
2:16
nothing's happening
2:17
I will type in my name press ok then our
2:21
console displays hello whatever your
2:24
name is
2:25
so that's a benefit of a while loop
2:27
repeat some code until this condition is
2:30
no longer true
2:31
since we populated our username our
2:34
username was not equal to an empty
2:35
string we filled username with some
2:37
characters
2:39
what if I instead press cancel
2:41
hello null null means no value
2:44
username will equal null if I press the
2:47
cancel button let's append this
2:49
condition
2:50
or
2:51
username is strictly equal to null
2:56
now I shouldn't be able to continue
2:58
until I type in something
3:03
and I can't escape if I hit cancel
3:06
while one of these conditions is true
3:09
execute this code Forever
3:11
let's type in our name again
3:15
and now we can escape the while loop
3:17
there's also another variation of a
3:19
while loop it's known as a do while loop
3:22
how that works is that you can move
3:23
while and the condition to the end
3:27
so we'll place it here
3:29
then precede the set of curly braces
3:31
with do so we will always execute this
3:34
code at least once then check the
3:37
condition at the end
3:38
using a do while loop I don't
3:40
necessarily need to set the username I
3:42
can set it to be undefined
3:46
if I set my username to be undefined
3:49
then use a standard while loop
3:54
we never execute the while loop our
3:57
username equals undefined it doesn't
3:59
equal an empty string or the value null
4:02
so we skip over the while loop entirely
4:05
so a do while loop is another variation
4:07
of a while loop do the code first then
4:10
check the condition at the end so
4:12
there's a few different ways you can
4:13
write the same program
4:15
all right let's go over another example
4:19
we'll create three variables let logged
4:22
in
4:23
logged in will be false to begin with
4:27
to log in we have to type in a matching
4:29
username
4:32
I will declare a username but not assign
4:34
it and a password
4:38
so let's create a while loop
4:41
how do we escape the while loop let's
4:43
say
4:44
while not I'll use the notch logical
4:47
operator while not logged in
4:51
once we're logged in once this is true
4:54
we escape the while loop we will ask a
4:57
user for their username username equals
5:00
window
5:01
dot prompt
5:05
enter your username
5:09
let's ask for a password as well
5:14
password equals enter your password
5:21
I'll add an if statement within the
5:23
while loop
5:24
we'll check to see if our username is
5:28
strictly equal to then make up some
5:30
username
5:31
my user
5:34
name
5:39
and if our password
5:42
is strictly equal to some password like
5:45
my password
5:48
if our username and password both match
5:51
these values then we can log in
5:54
so logged in will equal true
5:59
then I'll console.log a confirmation
6:01
message
6:03
you are logged in
6:09
else
6:10
let's console.log another message
6:14
invalid credentials
6:19
please try again
6:22
all right let's see if this works
6:25
enter your username
6:28
I am just going to press ok
6:31
enter your password I'll type in
6:33
something legitimate so I'll type in my
6:35
password
6:36
uh invalid credentials please try again
6:39
that's because I didn't type in a
6:40
username
6:42
I'll type in my username
6:44
be sure it matches
6:46
my username
6:49
my password
6:51
and we are now logged in
6:54
so since we set logged in to be true
6:56
when we go back to the beginning of our
6:58
while loop this condition is no longer
7:01
true while not logged in
7:04
but since we're logged in we escape the
7:06
while loop
7:07
now another variation of this is the do
7:09
while loop let's cut the condition along
7:12
with while added to the end
7:14
then add do to the beginning
7:18
so we'll check to see if we're logged in
7:20
at the end
7:21
it pretty much does the same thing but
7:23
with one exception in this program how
7:26
this is different is that I can set
7:28
logged in to be true to begin with we'll
7:30
still receive that prompt I'll type in
7:33
my username type in my password
7:35
we are currently logged in so we do not
7:37
continue the while loop if we used a
7:39
standard while loop
7:42
And We Begin by being logged in
7:45
well we never ask for any of this we
7:47
never enter the while loop
7:48
while not logged in do all of this but
7:51
since we are logged in we don't do any
7:53
of it alright everybody so that's while
7:55
Loops repeat some code while some
7:58
condition is true while some condition
8:01
remains true execute this code Forever
8:03
Until it's no longer true and well
8:06
everybody that's while Loops in
8:08
JavaScript
